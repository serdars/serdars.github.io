    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Notes and commentary on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Senge"&gt;Peter M. Senge's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Fifth-Discipline-Practice-Organization/dp/0553456342"&gt;The Fifth Discipline&lt;/a&gt; continues with the basics of the fifth discipline: Systems Thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="laws-of-the-fifth-discipline"&gt;Laws of the Fifth Discipline&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Today's problems come from yesterday's solutions: Today's problems are often caused by the partial solutions we have done to yesterday's problems.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The harder you push, the harder the system pushes back: One of our instincts to try a solution harder when it is not enough to fix a problem. Government's bail out program by its own doesn't solve the fundamental problem. It only makes them need more bail outs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Behavior grows better before it grows worse: After a partial solution you will see the situation improving slightly before it gets worse. Slight improvement is only temporary symptomatic fix before the underlying cause kicks in again, in a more strong way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The easy way out usually leads back in: To feel comfortable, we most of the time apply familiar solutions to the problems we face rather than looking for the real root cause and dealing with it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The cure can be worse than the disease: Most of the times, symptomatic solutions strengthen the underlying cause or create even bigger problems.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Faster is slower: Fastest way is the most commonly requested way in today's world. But it is not necessarily the best way. Optimal rate is most of the time not the fastest way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cause and effect are not closely related in time and space: Most of the time effects of our actions are visible sometime in the future and when that time comes we forget the action we have done in the past to see the connection.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Small changes can produce big results - but the areas of highest leverage are often least obvious.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can have your cake and eat it too - but not at once: Sometimes dilemmas present themselves as problems but they are an artifact of &lt;strong&gt;snapshot thinking rather than process thinking&lt;/strong&gt;. E.g. increasing the quality and decreasing the costs is not achievable when you think in terms of snapshots. Investing in training and testing can increase the quality and the costs. But overtime when the effects of these changes kick in, costs will be decreased due to reduced re-work, low level of defects, etc…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dividing an elephant in half does not produce two small elephants: Dividing a big problem into two most of the time doesn't produce two smaller problems. It changes the nature of the original problem and makes it impossible to track the root cause.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is no blame: When there is blame, there is "us" vs "them". Systems thinking requires to think ourselves and external entities as parts of a single system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a-shift-of-mind"&gt;A Shift of Mind&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in an extremely complex world which is getting more and more complex every day. There are few reasons that prevents us to analyze and understand the systems we live in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Separating the parts from the whole. Analyzing them and expecting to combine our analysis to explain to whole.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Letting go of responsibility saying "It is the way system is" or "System is too complex for me".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time we think in a linear way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Terrorist Attacks -&amp;gt; Threat to Americans -&amp;gt; Need to respond militarily&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we see only part of the problem. We miss the part of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;US Military Activity -&amp;gt; Perceived aggressiveness of US -&amp;gt; Terrorist Recruits -&amp;gt; Terrorist Attacks&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linear thinking only deals with the variables at hand. It deals with &lt;strong&gt;detail complexity&lt;/strong&gt;. There is a second type of complexity, &lt;strong&gt;dynamic complexity&lt;/strong&gt;, where cause and effect are subtle and distributed over time. Real leverage most of the time lies in understanding the dynamic complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systems Thinking gives us a framework in order to be able to understand and analyze the system as a whole. It enables us to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;See interrelationships rather than linear cause-effect chains&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;See processes of change rather than snapshots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It starts with &lt;strong&gt;feedback&lt;/strong&gt; concept and aims to recognize the types of structures or &lt;strong&gt;patterns&lt;/strong&gt; that occur again and again. It builds up a language with vocabulary that makes it easy to talk about systems and their composition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="words-of-the-language"&gt;Words of the Language&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systems are made up of circles but we see them as straight lines. Circles are simple ways to represent feedback inside a system. For e.g.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Example" src="/2014/12/18/peter-m-senge-the-fifth-discipline-part-2/basic.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the systems perspective, the human actor is part of the feedback process, not standing apart from it. This view shifts the way we are seeing our selves. Everyone shares the responsibility of the behaviors of the system, benefits as well as problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two distinct types of feedback loops:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reinforcing&lt;/strong&gt; (positive, amplifying) Non-Stable, Asymptotical Growth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balancing&lt;/strong&gt; (stabilizing) Stable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many feedback processes also contain &lt;strong&gt;delays&lt;/strong&gt;. The way to think about delays is to insert "things will happen eventually" on the influence line. Delays most of the time cause fluctuations before reaching the stable point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the nature, prety much all of the reinforcing processes have a counteracting balancing process. Balancing processes are said to have their own agendas or goals. However the stabilizing point of the process is not directly determined by the goals of the individual actors in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="sentences-of-the-language"&gt;Sentences of the Language&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sentences also called &lt;strong&gt;System Archetypes&lt;/strong&gt; are the common patterns that can be detected in the world. They are simple in their nature but we can see them all around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="limits-to-growth"&gt;Limits to Growth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reinforcing process is set in motion to produce a desired result. After creating a spiral of success it creates inadvertant side effects which manifests as a balancing process and limits the growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Management Principle:&lt;/strong&gt; Don't push growth. Remove the factors limiting growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Example" src="/2014/12/18/peter-m-senge-the-fifth-discipline-part-2/limits-to-growth.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pattern of Behavior:&lt;/strong&gt; In this process, limit gradually becomes more powerful. Eventually growth can slow and reinforcing process can start turning it back. You can see minor fluctuations if there are some solution attempts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage:&lt;/strong&gt; In these situations, instinctive behavior is to try to push harder. But the leverage is in the balancing loop. To change the behavior of the system identify and change or &lt;strong&gt;influence&lt;/strong&gt; the limiting factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="shifting-the-burden"&gt;Shifting the Burden&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An underlying problem generates symptoms that demand attention. But the underlying problem is difficult to discover or address (costly, cultural blocks, etc…) so people shift the burden to other solutions. Well intentioned but can only cure the symptoms temporarily. As underlying problem grows worse, and it mostly does, the impact will be felt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Management Principle:&lt;/strong&gt; Beware symptomatic solution. Only use it to remediate the pain if it is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Example" src="/2014/12/18/peter-m-senge-the-fifth-discipline-part-2/shifting-the-burden.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pattern of Behavior:&lt;/strong&gt; The best example is alcoholism. The size of the symptomatic response will grow over time as the underlying cause gets worse and worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage:&lt;/strong&gt; Leverage is in strengthening the fundamental response and weakening the symptomatic response. Communicating the symptomatic responses and fundamental responses help. Fundamental responses require long term orientation and shared vision. Symptomatic responses are needed only if the situation is dire and should be used temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="paragraphs-of-the-language"&gt;Paragraphs of the Language&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can form paragraphs using these sentences now. An example is a Company who creates a reinforcing process by utilizing a novel technology and achieves growth and faces a balancing process when it runs out of manufacturing capacity. They slowly erode their goals in delivery time which leads to frustrated customers and lower the sales numbers. However since the delivery time erosion is gradual (boiling frog syndrome) they don't realize it. They only see the decreased sales numbers and push more marketing strategies to increase them back up. Symptomatic solutions do not provide fixes to the underlying fundamental problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is actually another systems archetype called &lt;strong&gt;Growth and Underinvestment&lt;/strong&gt;. One would question how generalizable these archetypes are. But the important bit is that using the concepts as the language, our situation can be defined and talked about.  Without systems thinking it is hard to argue that the fundamental issue is the frustration about the delivery time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to argue with the principle of leverage. We all know the metaphor of not being able to see the forest for the trees. Unfortunately when we step back sometimes we still don't see the forest, we only see trees. Systems thinking provides us the language to be able to see the forest and the trees at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

For a more in depth study of the topic Kahneman's &lt;strong&gt;Thinking Fast and Slow&lt;/strong&gt; is a more appropriate book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banaji calls the biases &lt;strong&gt;MindBugs&lt;/strong&gt;. </summary>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahzarin_Banaji"&gt;Mahzarin Banaji&lt;/a&gt;'s book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blindspot-Hidden-Biases-Good-People/dp/0553804642"&gt;Blindspot&lt;/a&gt; is an easily approachable book that discusses the biases we all carry subconsciously. For a more in depth study of the topic Kahneman's &lt;strong&gt;Thinking Fast and Slow&lt;/strong&gt; is a more appropriate book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banaji calls the biases &lt;strong&gt;MindBugs&lt;/strong&gt;.  They can be classified into two: Personal vs Social. She goes into a lot of details around memory on the Personal side and stereotypes and race on the social side. Here is a very high level summary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memory is a tricky tool. Most of the times when we retrieve something from our memory, we find ourselves pretty confident about it. However in reality this is far from truth. Memory doesn't work as a computer hard disk. It doesn't store an experience and play it back exactly as it is. It stores the experience in relationship to all other previous experiences and mental models we have in our minds and it retrieves similarly. Here is an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People watching a video of a car crash remember the event differently when asked about "Do you recall how the blue car smashed into the red car?" vs "Do you recall the how blue car accidentally hit the red car?". They also form different initial opinions / prejudices against the driver of the blue car based on the question they are asked. This is called Retroactive Interference. An event interferes with the memory of a different event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can recall things with higher repetition more easily therefore we are more confident about the details of these memories. Vividness also increases the availability of the events from memory. It is more easier to remember "how I splashed wine over the pure white carpet violently when leaving the room" than "how I throw the wine glass to the floor when leaving the room".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to social biases, we all prefer and associate things based on personal and collective historical experiences. It is proven with Implicit Association Tests (IATs) that pretty much all of us has racial and gender associations (even feminists). However note that discriminatory behavior is not necessarily directly correlated with having an implicit association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
A man and his son are driving to a championship football game. On the road, they crash into a car. The father is killed instantly, and the son, critically injured, is rushed to the hospital. As the medics rush the son to the operating room, the doctor walks in and say’s, “I can’t operate, that’s my son”.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could this be true?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stereotypes are both true and false. They are a byproduct of our minds which is continuously classifying information in the world into certain buckets. They change over time. They are mostly negative (I'm fully bought into this idea). They can be harmful to our society because they impact convictions of judges, treatment of doctors. They can be also harmful to ourselves because they can turn into self fulfilling prophecies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly according to a study Turkish stereotype in 1930s was in the order of priority:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cruel, very religious, treacherous, sensual, ignorant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same study found out the Turkish stereotype in 2001 to be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Very religious, extremely nationalistic, tradition loving, quick tempered, aggressive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Notes and commentary on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Senge"&gt;Peter M. Senge's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Fifth-Discipline-Practice-Organization/dp/0553456342"&gt;The Fifth Discipline&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Five Disciplines represent approaches for developing three core learning capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fostering Aspiration
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Personal Mastery&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Shared Vision&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reflective Conversation
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Mental Models&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Dialogue&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understanding Complexity
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Systems Thinking&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deming points out that management systems and our education systems are very much alike. The 8 elements that Deming points out under the context of Total Quality Management can be applied to education systems as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Management by Measurement: Focusing on short-term metrics, Devaluing intangibles.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compliance-based cultures: Management by fear. (Again more Ken Robinson’s talk.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Managing outcomes: Management sets targets. People are accountable reaching them without the permission to change the system.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Right Answers vs Wrong Answers: Technical Problem Solving is emphasized.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Uniformity: Superficial agreement is more important than conflict.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Predictability / Controllability: Holy Trinity of Management: Plan - Organize - Control.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Excessive competitiveness and distrust: Competition is essential to outcome and innovation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Loss of the whole: Fragmentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="how-our-actions-create-our-reality-and-how-can-we-change-it"&gt;How our actions create our reality… and how can we change it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id="five-disciplines"&gt;Five Disciplines&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an innovation to occur you need more than 1 piece of technology. Consumerization of the aircraft required 5 technologies: variable-pitch propeller, landing gear, light-wieghted body, radial air-cooled engine and wing flaps. Without wing flaps Boeing couldn’t successfully innovate 1 year before McDouglas. Similarly a learning organization needs to master 5 separate but re-inforcing skills:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Personal Mastery: Discipline of continuously clarifying and deepening our vision.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mental Models: Deeply ingrained assumptions, generalizations, even pictures &amp;amp; images that influence how we understand the world. Working with mental models require us to turn the mirror to inside, i.e. trying to understand how we understand things.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Building a Shared Vision: Unearthing shared “pictures of the future” that foster genuine commitment and enrollment rather than compliance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Team Learning: Capacity to make “dialogue”, to suspend assumptions and enter into a thinking mode. When possible IQ of the team becomes higher than the individuals forming the team however this happens seldomly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Systems Thinking: As a Toyota manager pointed out, West does all the things we do but still can not reach similar results. Because in addition to having individual components, bringing them together as a whole is another requirement. This is why System Thinking, the binding discipline is the Fifth Discipline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do we mean by learning is really important. It is not reading a book, passing your class, getting AA from the exam, getting a plus from your teacher, promoting to Senior Software Engineer. In addition to these, it is internalizing a certain piece of information, working on adopting this information and changing your behavior along this information. You don’t learn bicycle riding after reading a book. Learning is getting to the heart of it and also of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="learning-disabilities"&gt;Learning Disabilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am my position: In our jobs, most of us see ourselves in a system on which we have no influence. We describe the task we do day to day, not the purpose of the greater enterprise.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The enemy is out there: When we think ourselves as our jobs, as a result we think that enemy is out there when something goes wrong. We don’t generally see the secondary (or further) consequences of our actions beyond our immediate circle.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The illusion of taking charge: Taking aggressive action against an external entity during crisis is not really being proactive. Most of the times pro-activeness is reactiveness is disguise. True pro-activeness comes from seeing how we contribute to our own problems.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The fixation on events: When two children get into a fight it goes like “But, he hit my ball” / “But he broke my toy” / “But he called me …” Focusing on the events distract us from seeing the longer-term patterns of change that lie behind the events.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The parable of the boiled frog: We can not escape the fate of boiled frog until we slow down and see the gradual processes that often pose great threats.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The delusion of learning from experience: True learning comes from experience. But if we can not observe the consequences of our actions (because they are in distant feature or they are in a separate part of the organization), we can’t learn from them. Each of us has a “learning horizon”. Cycles are especially hard to see. For e.g. due to lack of chip designers, most of the students are going into chip design which over-saturates chip designers when they are graduating which makes very few people to go into it which results in a shortage after 4 years etc…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The myth of the management team: The management team who should be able to fight these disabilities generally end up fighting for turf, trying to save their image… They operate well under routine conditions but their “team-ness” goes away when under pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id="prisoners-of-the-system-or-prisoners-of-our-own-thinking"&gt;Prisoners of the system or prisoners of our own thinking?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_distribution_game"&gt;Beer Distribution Game&lt;/a&gt;: Composed of Retailer / Wholesaler / Brewery. An advertisement bumps the customer demand by 100%. This creates a cycles of inventory shortages followed by over-stocking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Independent of the people who are playing the game, the end result is generally the same. Players end up blaming each other and assume their problems are due to fluctuating customer demand even tough in reality it is stable. The lesson is that structure of the system influences the behaviors of the players. There are good strategies to play but we don’t stop &amp;amp; think to find them. Structure in human systems is subtle and leverage most of the time comes from new ways of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tolstoy argues that Napoleon wasn’t the cause of the Wars / Revolution. History, and many number of individuals created Napoleon then took him down. (Salut to Geopolitics concept). “Structure” used here doesn’t mean the organization chart or logical structure. It points to the “key interrelationships that influence behavior over time”. E.g. “delay in the delivery from wholesaler to retailer” increases “the order of retailers from the wholesaler”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to be successful, one must re-define their scope of influence. Your influence is broader than the limits of your position. Retailer can influence suppliers behavior by placing orders or not. “Either the large system works, or your position will not work."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systems perspective shows us that there are multiple levels of explanation in any complex situation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Systemic Structure - generative -&amp;gt; Patterns of Behavior - responsive -&amp;gt; Events - reactive&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since event explanations are the most common in contemporary culture, reactive management prevails. Behavior pattern explanations focus on seeing long term trends and assessing their implications. E.g. distributions systems are prone to instability which becomes more severe the further you move away from the retailer. This level helps us understand and respond to shifting trends. Structural explanation is the least command and most powerful. They explain the causes of the patterns of behavior. Franklin Roosevelt explained how the banking system worked in a public speech about why “Bank Holiday” is happening and was successful in shifting the negative public view on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we understand the structure of the system that causes its behavior, we can clearly see our power to change that behavior. Most of the time we discover something similar to what Walt Kelly discovered in Pogo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have met the enemy and he is us."&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some notes and commentary from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_DeMarco"&gt;Tom DeMarco's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Second-Edition/dp/0932633439"&gt;Peopleware&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="team-sociology"&gt;Team Sociology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Majority of the problems that stand between a project and success are generally not technical problems but sociological ones. &lt;strong&gt;Politics&lt;/strong&gt; is not the right word when talking about these problems. This word is used when we don't want to engage with some problems. We classify them as institutional, un-fixable and classify them under &lt;strong&gt;Politics&lt;/strong&gt; to excuse ourselves from attempting to solve them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="theory-of-values"&gt;Theory of Values&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been two theories of value historically. Spanish Theory of Value stated that there is a fixed amount of value on the Earth so the way to extract more value is to try to be more efficient when using resources. English Theory of Value stated that additional value can be obtained by ingenuity and technology. Spain ended up going around the world to try to extract more value from land. English went through the industrial revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="efficiency--productivity"&gt;Efficiency &amp;amp; Productivity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are most efficient &amp;amp; productive when we are in &lt;strong&gt;flow&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the state where we are spending effort effortlessly, not aware of the time and our surroundings and focusing on one thing only without any interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional methods to boost efficiency &amp;amp; productivity (like overtime, long hours, etc…) are only useful for a short amount of time. They are like sprinting. If we are sprinting all the time, we will get tired. We will not be working better we will only be working faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to try to maximize the uninterrupted hours in order to boost productivity. (See email and meetings section as well.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="deadlines--pressure"&gt;Deadlines / Pressure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's Law: Some British dude Parkinson theorized that work expands the time allocated for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully Parkinson's Law and the Spanish Value Theory is not attempted in most of the organizations nowadays. Phony deadlines are still used as a mutated form of the Parkinson's law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When all the team knows that a deadline is phony, there is no reason for a manager to stick with it other than insecurity and neediness. Rather than attempting to create pressure (which decreases the productivity), a manager should be able to create a common sense of a goal for team to align at (which increases productivity).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="quality"&gt;Quality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the builders take pride in the work we do. We would like our work to shine and get used by many people. No one wants to build a low quality piece of software and watch people use it. We have internal quality requirements for the software we are building. This level is both rational and emotional. We set ourselves for the future by ensuring we have strong enough technical roots from which our tree can grow. We also form a connection between the quality of the thing we're building and our abilities as a builder. The lower the quality, the worse our perception will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swimming against this natural flow of quality, most of the times due to pressure to ship, is counter-productive. Not only because it sets the team up to spend more time supporting &amp;amp; maintaining a low quality product but also it de-motivates the team since team now views itself as a low quality team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="corporate-entropy"&gt;Corporate Entropy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entropy is the level of sameness. In corporations similar to the universe, entropy always increases. The higher the entropy, the lower the chances of great energy and creative work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="office-environment"&gt;Office Environment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many factors in an office environment that might impact a team. Not surprisingly, curiosity of many failed to find a direct link between any aspect of an environment and productivity. But there are a few things to keep in mind when thinking about the physical environment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Privacy: &lt;strong&gt;Flow&lt;/strong&gt; is only possible in silent spots with minimized distractions and with privacy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Having people working together close is preferred since it helps them build relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Entropy in a physical environment is a subconscious sign of entropy in the culture of the company. It should be watched out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every one works better in an environment that they can tailor to their specific needs. When teams are doing this, it is a great sign of developing team identity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(As always) Christopher Alexander's Organic Order Theory provides some patterns to be included in an environment for different needs of teams:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tailored workspace from a kit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Windows&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Public Space&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Teams can find more for themselves if they think.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environment is always in evolution. The thing to watch out for is the signs of distress in it. E.g. people reserving conference room in order to hide and work, listening music with speaker phones to control white noise and interruptive noise, etc… These can be signs of limitations in the environment or in a bigger scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="people"&gt;People&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high level strategy recommended can be summarized as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get the right people.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make them happy so they don't leave&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn them loose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than connectionless aptitude tests, technical questions with yes no answers, and out of the box packages; it is important to try to measure the connection between the candidate and the team. If a team is forming an identity, ensuring this identity is coherent when hiring is important. Also hiring is a great tool to decrease the entropy of teams when needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From accounting point of view it is different to give $100 to utilities and to buy a server. Server is part of infrastructure so it is not a direct expense. Similar way of thinking should be applied to human capital. Investing in a conference or training is not necessarily a direct expense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people leave, or company downsizes, there are hidden costs in the system for teams. Assuming a replacement is found immediately, obvious one is the ramp up time for the new comer as well as extra time needed from the members to mentor the new comer. Less obvious one is the risk to team relationships and recovery of the normalness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching the turnover rate is a must for every manager. Great teams have low turn over rates. People behave as if they are not expected to leave. In normal teams people leave because:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No long term involvement and no reason for long term involvement with the job.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Feeling of disposability.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seeing loyalty as reasonless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id="jelled-team"&gt;Jelled Team&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jelled Team is a highly functioning team. They have a sense of identity. Individuals have goals and these are aligned with the team's goals. Members have a sense of eliteness and when doing their jobs they enjoy themselves. A great example is Black Team @ IBM. Sense of eliteness may lead to turning the team into a clique. This is something to be watched for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The job of the manager is not to lead the team. It is to remove the blocks in the team's road and prepare the rest of the teams for this team's momentum. The things a manager can do to kill these types of teams are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Defensive Management: When manager doesn't trust his team members, he is in trouble. Without autonomy jelled teams are unachievable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bureaucracy: Unnecessary process, documentation will slow a team down and decrease the motivation of individual members.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Physical Separation:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time Fragmentation: Flow breaker, productivity killer and demoralizer due to decreased amount of perceived progress. The biggest sin of all.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quality:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Phony Deadlines:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clique Control: Breaking up a team during their momentum building stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coaching and leadership in jelled teams are not done by a single person. Since members complete each other, they also coach each other in the areas that they are strong at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competition is tricky. It can be good or bad based on the situation. One of the possible things that can kill a team is the performance ratings though. Any action that rewards team members differentially is likely to foster adversary competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can't put together jelled team all the time but they can increase the chances of a team getting jelled up. A few things one can do are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trusting team members.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sensible subordination: Knowing when to break the rules.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Augmenting / protecting team identity &amp;amp; feeling of eliteness&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Natural authority: Manager doesn't invoke the power given to her from the upper levels.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Providing satisfying closure: As human being we all need some reassurance that we're headed in the right direction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Structured as a network, not a hierarchy: There is no permanent leader. Depending on the situation each person leads at different times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="leadership"&gt;Leadership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A manager invites her team to her place for a dinner. When people show up they drink a couple of beers and chat. Manager admits that she didn't have time to prep a dinner and says that we should be talented enough to put together a spaghetti dinner. Without any further directions and one fellow starts on the salad and the other is putting together a sauce. The new comer offers his signature garlic bread. Manager chimes in when someone needs the onions cut. They eat until they are full and get started on the cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manager's effort is invisible. It all seems natural. Good managers provide opportunities for teams to succeed together (periodic demos are an example of this kind) and build momentum. They have a subconscious understanding / feeling of what's good for the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="risk"&gt;Risk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the great things that can be done with low risk is already done. One needs to question what he is doing if there is no risk involved. One risk that we do never manage is our own failure. This is not fun since working in case you fail is demotivating. This should only be done when the consequences of our failure is so dire that they can not be contained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="meetings"&gt;Meetings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are all aware of the potential meeting hell we can fall into anytime. One of the tricks to see if a meeting is a working meeting or non-working meeting is to check if "What needs to happen for this meeting to end?" question can be answered. Some examples of non-working meeting are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ceremonies: Mostly due to defensive management, where manager talks with each member one by one and forces the others to listen. Mostly to assert the manager-ness.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Laptop Meetings: Where everyone works on the laptops.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visibility Meetings: In order for people to increase their visibility across the organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="corporate-spam-and-silent-consent"&gt;Corporate Spam and Silent Consent&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to unnecessary meetings, our email is also filled with unnecessary emails. Most of the reasons why we have so many are similar with the reasons we have many meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important note for emails is the "silent consent". The default rule in corporations is that if you're included in an email chain and if you don't raise your voice, you specify your consent. This results in defensive emailing in order to make sure that you don't give your consent to things that you don't want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also the missing trust between the manager and the team members cause a lot  of unnecessary &lt;strong&gt;FYI&lt;/strong&gt; email traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="change"&gt;Change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human beings detest change. We work against this force when trying to change the way people interact with the world. We also detest change in workplace. When we encounter or propose a change there are 3 fundamental response types:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blindly loyal (asks no questions)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Believers but Questioners
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Skeptics (Show me)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Passive Observers (What's in it for me?)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Opposed (Fear of Change)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Opposed (Fear of loss of power)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Militantly Opposed (will undermine and destroy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success depends on the way "Believers but Questioners" are handled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think that change is modeled this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
Old Status Quo ---(A better idea)--&amp;gt; New Status Quoa
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However a more close approximation is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
Old Status Quo ---(Foreign Element)---&amp;gt; Chaos --(Transforming Idea)---&amp;gt;
  Practice and Integration ---&amp;gt; New Status Quo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being aware of this model helps us with the changes. One last thing to note about change is that in order for any change to be effective, &lt;code&gt;failure&lt;/code&gt; should be an option. People should feel safe to make mistakes otherwise risk aversion will prevent any change in its infancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="organizational-learning"&gt;Organizational Learning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a difference between Experience and Learning. Definition of learning also includes the incorporation of whatever is the thing one is learning into their lives. At organizational level this means an organization changes its behavior based on the experiences and findings it makes. This is a long subject that we will cover in detail in the Fifth Discipline book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a critical question authors point out is &lt;strong&gt;where&lt;/strong&gt; it happens in an organization. Since top management is too high to see the day to day things and individual contributors are too busy with the day to day things, the only place there this can happen is middle management. And for this to happen, middle management should be talking to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="various"&gt;Various&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coding War Games: Where the authors put developers against each other to code a component indicated that people from the same company ended up having similar results. Authors conclude that good engineers are in good companies and mediocre ones are in mediocre companies. A better way of saying this IMO is, an engineering team is successful when it can ensure the good engineers come and stay in it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gilb's Law: Anything you need to quantify can be measured in some way that it superior to not measuring at all.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;E-factor: Uninterrupted Hours / Body-Present Hours&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deterministic vs Non-Deterministic Systems: Deterministic systems can not self-heal since there is no human being present at the time. Automating all the things is not the right solution. With a process (methodology) one needs to be aware of this and ensures that opportunities to heal an automated system are possible and easy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Early Overstaffing: A good way to waste time. In general for most of the projects, at the beginning it's much easier to go with a small number of people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Part 1 of the magnum opus of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman"&gt;Daniel Kahneman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1417992744"&gt;Thinking Fast &amp;amp; Slow&lt;/a&gt; talks about how the mind works. These are my notes from this section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our judgement &amp;amp; decision making is hugely impacted by the biases that we are not consciously aware of.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(Cue -&amp;gt; Access to Memory -&amp;gt; Answer) a.k.a. Intuition.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We are most of the time overconfident about the things we believe we know and most of the time unable to acknowledge the full extent of our ignorance and the uncertainty of the world we live in.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hindsight bias positive feedback loop + “I” centric view that we’ve adopted during rationalism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-characters-of-the-story"&gt;The Characters of the Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our minds are composed of two systems. System 1 &amp;amp; System 2.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;System 1 operates automatically quickly without voluntary control.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;System 2 is the voice in our heads the one that we believe we are. Requires attention.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Question: What is the difference between attention and consciousness?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Invisible Gorilla study&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;System 1 and System 2 continiously conflict. Optical illusions are the most basic examples.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;System 2 needs to put in effort to not let System 2 go ahead and execute a potentially less advantageous choice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Best we can do in these situations is to recognize the conflict and spend effort as necessary based on the stakes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A sentence is understood more easily if it describes what an agent (System 2) does than if it describes what something is, what properties it has.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Kahneman creates 2 characters for System 1 and System 2. We should note this analogy applies to System 2 better than System 1 since System 2 is already a voice in our heads but System 1 is composed of many voices in our heads. The way I think about System 1 is being composed of many people who are shouting whatever they recognize as loud as they can to another person who continuously listens to these and selects some of them based on a criteria that he knows and raises them to System 2. System 2’s input the System 1, is not direct. If System 2 does something enough times, System 1 changes its behavior. It adopts the things System 2 does. It tries to make System 2’s job easier. We should note that this is all an analogy :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="attention-and-effort"&gt;Attention and Effort&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In order for System 2 to work, it needs to spend energy. System 1 doesn’t do certain tasks by default like basic math. We use “mental effort” to make it work. As with other energies it has a maximum and total amount of energy it can spend.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Getting skilled in a task reduces the amount of mental effort required to do it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;System 2 can program System 1 on a temporary basis. Like count the number of words in this page. You will start with 1, 2, 3 and start building up strategies where you bump up the number every time you see a space and slowly bump it up so that System 2 throws you something when it passes over 5 spaces, etc…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;See Speed Reading classes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Humans operate under the law of least effort. They think as little as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is due to the sheer amount of information mind gets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-lazy-controller"&gt;The Lazy Controller&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every task requires a certain amount of attention. Even walking. If you think hard enough you will walk to places you never know without recollecting how you end up there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you try to modify your walking stride, you will not be able to think clearly anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ideal condition is “flow” where System 2 effortlessly spends effort and one likes it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;System 2 can be depleted. It can’t get things done when it is.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remember the Willpower book. Ego depletion makes self control tough when faced with a challenge. Similar to willpower, System 2 has a muscle one needs to build.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Glucose boosts System 2 quickly and temporarily.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;"Intelligence is not only the ability to reason. It is also the ability to find the relevant material in memory and deploy attention when needed.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By default, people operate in “Intellectual Sloth” mode. Total opposite of Chomsky’s recommendation “Intellectual Self Defense”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Intelligent vs Rational (or Engaged): Intelligence raw horse power. Rational (Engaged) is the controller that drives the raw power to reach to a destination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="associative-machine"&gt;Associative Machine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;System 1 works by association. When it sees the word “vomit” it recalls bad memories, makes you feel a little bit disgusted.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;System 2 is generally not aware of what happens in System 1 unless you are doing a lot of meditation :)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The fact that you can still read a sentence even tough each word is missing a letter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Priming: When we see words that are related to “oldness” we move slowly. When we see words related to money, our greediness (related to that individualism) is primed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="cognitive-ease"&gt;Cognitive Ease&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ease is the state we’re in when we feel good, doing things effortless. Maybe caused by repeated experience (familiarity), priming, good mood, clear display (?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Illusion of Remembering: “The experience of familiarity has a simple but powerful quality of ‘pastness’ that seems to indicate that it is a direct reflection of prior experience.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We generally confuse familiarity with remembering.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Illusion of Truth: “When you say something 40 times it becomes a truth.” - Turkish saying&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We generally confuse repetition therefore familiarity with truth.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you need to make something more believable:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduce the cognitive strain (make it easy to read / understand)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use simpler words&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put your ideas in verse if you can&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quote people with names that are easy to pronounce&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cognitive strain mobilizes System 2 which is more likely to reject the intuitive answer suggested by System 1.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When we are uncomfortable and unhappy our System 1 is affected. We lose touch with out intuition.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This maybe related to worry / aversion where they have a priority in System 1 before creativity or solving miscellaneous problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="norms-surprise-and-causes"&gt;Norms, Surprise and Causes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;System 1 maintains and updates a model about your personal life and what’s normal in it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Surprise is a great indication of what are our expectancies and how we model life.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repetition decreases the impact of surprises.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;System 1 models the world and sets theories on normal by constantly making causality chains.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This reflects in us as a constant search for causalities in between events.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In fact all the headlines do is to satisfy our need for coherence. In reality large events have many consequences and many consequences require many causes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And there is also intention. Intention is always mixed up with causality. When you’re picking up something with your hand you experience it as if the decision an inner you gave caused you to pick up the thing with your hand. “Paul Bloom in Atlantic 2005 made a provocative claim that our inborn readiness to separate physical and intentional causality explains the near universality of religious beliefs. Since we perceive the world of objects as essentially separate from the world of minds, we can envision soulless bodies and bodiless souls. Two different modes of causation make us natural to accept a divinity as the cause of physical world. Two concepts of causality are shaped by evolution building the origins of religion into System 1."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This is very inline with meditative texts. It is argued that if you look closely you can witness the momentary difference between the time intention forms in the brain due to many causes and the time your hand picks up the thing. However connecting this to the causality of physical world is a little bit overkill. Near universality of religious beliefs can be explained by the new universality of the nature of the human needs and resources available to them at the given time. I don’t think people believe because their System 1 is imprinted. They believe because it is much easier, explains a lot of the questions, removes fear, etc… The intention causality is a by product of our self concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Heider made an experiment by moving a triangle and square next to each other up over a diagonal line. When he added two eyes to the triangle, participants explained the situation as “triangle is chasing the square over the hill”. Eyes triggered System 1 to find a causality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="a-machine-for-jumping-to-conclusions"&gt;A Machine for Jumping to Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;System 1 automatically connects the dots in between the information it receives and jumps to conclusions and throws these away to System 2. System 2, unless it spends time, doesn’t think about the assumptions there and accepts the conclusions it is given and usually doesn’t even detect that they came from a System 1 after an automated process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is great in the world we live in because many of the decisions we need to take can be handled with a way like this. It is cost effective and efficient unless the times where it fails are does not have too high cost.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;System 1 is ready to believe and get a conclusion. This results in a confirmation bias. Different things will come into your mind if you’re asked “Is Sam friendly?” or “Is Sam unfriendly?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Halo Effect: The tendency to like / dislike everything (even the things you didn’t see) about a person / thing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consequence of Halo Effect: Initial impressions effect later impressions of a thing / person.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reading exam papers question by question rather than student by student. How does the grades change?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Success of System 1 is based on the coherence of the story it generates, not the amount and quality of the data it is based on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;She is intelligent, strong, corrupt and cruel vs She is corrupt, cruel, intelligent and strong.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Framing: Different ways of presenting the same information generates different emotions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;System 1 focus on the existing evidence and ignores the absent evidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="how-judgements-happen"&gt;How Judgements Happen&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;System 1 continuously monitors the environment and makes assessments. (gut feelings when we see a person)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Primarily shaped by the evolution so assessments are about survival / food / etc…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;System 1 can calculate averages very easily but doesn’t do so well on the sums.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Because it can do comparisons easily.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;System 1 can do intensity matching. It can assign a shade of red to a specific crime denoting its intensity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;System 1 casts a wide net in its monitoring and generates a range of ideas rather than a focused few.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="answering-an-easier-question"&gt;Answering an Easier Question&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In order to be able to move fast, we replace a hard question with a basic (heuristic) question and answer the basic question.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Without self-awareness, we don’t realize this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Heuristic Replacement is a by product of mental shotgun and intensity matching, needs to be detected by System 2 and reversed in case stakes are high.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Happiness Mood Heuristic (recent happenings determine long term happiness) / Affect Heuristic (likes / dislikes determine other things)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;– Noam Chomsky&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raw notes from &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Power-Systems-Conversations-Democratic-Challenges/dp/0805096159/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1417400238&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;Power Systems&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky"&gt;Noam Chomsky&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-new-american-imperialism"&gt;The New American Imperialism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Imperialism vs Settler Colonialism: Latter is the worst where the people are "exterminated" than the former.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;American decline should be taken with a grain of salt. America hit the top after WW2. At that time it had 50% of world wealth. Nowadays it has around 25%. When you portray as one should have everything, losing some might seem like a loss but indeed it is not.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adam Smith said that "In England people who own the society make the policy and these are merchant and manufacturers." Nowadays this has changed to be financial institutions and multi-nationals. And for e.g. they have an interest in Chinese Development.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If one measures the growth correctly, not just the number of products but also the costs and benefits of making them; Chine should be rated lower than its current position in Human Development Index.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;"War is a racket. Few profit, many pay." US Major General Smedley Butler from &lt;a href="http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/warisaracket.html"&gt;War is a Racket&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1915: US disbanded Haitian parliament at gunpoint, since it had refused to accept a US written constitution which enabled US corporations to buy Haitian island. Idea was that Haiti needed foreign investment to grow and US wouldn't invest if they didn't own something. Haitian people didn't understand this and parliament was dissolved. Under US control a referendum passed with 99.9% with only 5% of the population participating.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After 9/11 Bush ordered Taliban to hand over Osama Bin Laden. They asked for evidence of his participation in 9/11. US didn't have any but reacted with contempt "How can you ask for evidence?" People are informed that bombing will start soon unless Taliban gives Osama Bin Laden. After 3 weeks British said bombing will continue unless people don't overthrow their government. Taliban might be over-thrown from within but US wanted to impose its choice of regime for Afghanistan therefore it was invaded. Similar to Iraq.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Smaller countries hire individual terrorists like Carlos the Jackal. US hires terrorist states like Israel, and sometimes Taiwan and Britain.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In US one is not supposed to use the term "working class", correct terminology is "Middle Class / Underclass".&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How Hitler was elected? Germany was under control of Hindenburg, a Prussian that had the support of bourgeois. They were not doing anything for people. Depression hit. Hitler a charismatic leader appeared to nationalism and said he can fix the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Weekend protestors: People who go out protesting on the weekend and expect results thereafter. However results are not taken by sitting in front of White House for 3 weeks. They need to be consistent. However "Quick gratification culture is not conducive to that kind of commitment."&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Problem with the Democratic Party is that they can not come out and say: Look back in 1970s we've participated the major process of financialization of the economy. Wealth started to accumulate in the pockets of few. These are our policies. There is no real left but atomic groups of people with special interests such as environmentalism, gay rights, etc…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="chains-of-submission-and-subservience"&gt;Chains of Submission and Subservience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mental slavery didn't replace slavery. It has always existed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In highly democratic societies, propaganda systems are very strong because of the clear articulated recognition that people had gained so many rights that it was hard to suppress them by force.
When Britain abolished slavery officially, they still needed to run their plantations with slaves so they offered gifts and easy term for them to acquire consumer goods based with debt to plantations and system continued to work. The United Fruit company did the same thing in Central America. These techniques are as old as the world. Consumers are a lot easier to fabricate than tarter chambers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Public education, social security are kind of concepts (principle of solidarity) that go against personal doctrine that you should just look after yourself and let everyone fall. If you are trying to maximize profits of consumption, then working together is the wrong idea. Solidarity makes people harder to control and prevents them being passive objects of private power. &lt;em&gt;[Self Note: This is very similar to the concept of polygamy vs monogamy from Red Queen. Polygamy results in few people controlling most of the mates in a society.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="uprisings"&gt;Uprisings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What tips of an uprising is usually random. Like one person setting himself on fire in Tunisia. All the time however there is a lot of background leading up to it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Arab Spring is a revolt against Western backed dictators throughout the region.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Saudi Arabia has exercised very strong violence to stop the uprising in itself and Bahrain. This didn't fly a lot in western media.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;However when the situation is delicate and you have a unreliable dictator who has plenty of oil but who was unreliable, you would want to change it with a reliable one such as the case of Libya.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Egypt and Tunisia, the game is an old one. You support a dictator until the end when he loses all the control and support. When this becomes impossible shelve him off somewhere, issue dramatic proclamations about democracy and then restore the old regime to the extent possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Currently still most of the energy producing countries are under western backed dictatorships. Iraq was one flowing out which was recently restored (kind of). Arab Spring's process is limited but not insignificant.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iraq was not fully restored but this was not due to declining US economy but due to diversification of global power centers. [I.e. I can't control all the world anymore I'm losing…]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Matthew Yglesias principle: One of the main functions of the international institutional order is precisely to legitimate the use of deadly military force by western powers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Western countries want stability but the definition of stability is conformity to Western orders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="domestic-disturbances"&gt;Domestic Disturbances&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Occupy movement has succeeded in tapping feelings, attitudes and understanding that were hidden. It had progress. Obviously there was a massive propaganda to undermine it, framing it as politics of envy. "Get a shower and get a job."&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;"Occupying" was a tactic that is extremely successful. It brought people together to talk. "Atomization is a technique of control and marginalization." But every tactic has a half-life. After a while you start to see diminishing returns.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Also a lesson to learn: unless labor movement is revitalized, a movement will not go really far.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Holder vs Humanitarian Law Project Case: Humanitarian Law Project organization was giving advice to the organizations under US terrorist list on strategies of non-violence. Supreme Court said this is material advice. FBI raided members' houses for evidence, etc…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The terrorist list is also an interesting one. One that included Nelson Mandela for a long time and one from which Saddam Hussein was removed so that US can provide him support.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Case of Omar Khadr: 15 year old boy who defended his village from invading forces in this case US Army, was taken to Guantanamo for 8 years than offered a choice either plead guilty and spend another 8 years or stay here indefinitely. Strikingly he was a Canadian citizen for which Canada has done zip.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Occupy movement's leaderless mentality was a good thing which made them prevent develop a specific line such as in order to be Republican you need to accept 10 things, no tax on wealthy, if there is someone we don't like out there we kill them… However being leaderless had the downside of having none beating drums all the time for continuity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Howard Zinn once commented that (P78). This was echoes previously by David Hume. "Power is always on the side of the governed." In modern societies this is counter by indoctrination and pacification. Thanks to Edward Bernays.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Economics tell that markets are based on informed consumers making rational choices. But marketing is an effort that is to uniform people and have them make irrational decisions in favor of consumerism. Similarly current state of politics and voting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Aristotle pointed out that when people have the right to vote, the majority will be the poor and they will use this right to take away property from the rich which wouldn't be fair so we have to prevent this. Aristotle tried to fix this by reducing the inequality and putting in welfare programs. James Madison faced the same problem and proposed to increase inequality with land reform back at the time. US constitution followed Madison's approach. House is closer the public with less powers. Senate was not elected had the most of the power.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This was a failed theory. When people have the right to vote, since the majority is poor and behind in the intellectual advancement, the politicians with conservative and popular policies will always have an advantage over liberal politicians. It is up to liberal politicians to figure out a way to overcome this handicap and win the election and then implement steps to reduce this handicap for the long term.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="unconventional-wisdom"&gt;Unconventional Wisdom&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Austerity is the worst thing you can do during a recession.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Geopolitical discussion from EU -&amp;gt; Turkey -&amp;gt; Kurds -&amp;gt; Iran -&amp;gt; India -&amp;gt; Pakistan …&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mental-slavery"&gt;Mental Slavery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A decent propaganda system doesn't announce its principles or intentions. You presuppose a framework and then people just come to accept it. Soviet propaganda or Church propaganda is not highly successful because they told people what to do and believe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In 2008, Advertising Age a marketing conference gave the best campaign award to Obama campaign.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;"Reading a book doesn't mean just turning the pages. It means thinking about it, identifying part that you want to go back to, asking how to place it in a broader context, pursuing the ideas. There is no point in reading a book it you let it pass before your eyes and then forget about it ten minutes later. You might as well not be reading."&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One of the interesting piracy case is around pharmaceuticals. They want to prevent piracy of drugs being cheaply produced in India / China. They claim that they need the high profit margin for new research and development. (P108) According to Dean Baker, if the cost of pharmeteuitcal research was picked up by public, there would be huge cost savings because the majority of the research is done under public namespace anyways. Companies do the finishing part of the research and marketing / packaging.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(P117) "I'm sure you get a lot of questions like 'Election is upon us Chomsky. What should I do? Vote or stay at home?' How do you respond to that?" "The first thing I say is that you should spend about 5 minutes on your question. There are much more important questions. But the question about elections doesn't require much thought. For president, there will be two candidates you don't like. One will be plausibly much more dangerous than the other. If you are in a safe state, i.e. if you know how the vote would come out you have choices. You can say "OK I won't vote or I'll vote for some party that's trying to become an independent alternative say Greens. If you're in a swing state, you have to ask yourself: Is it better to help the worse candidate to be elected? There might be a case for this."&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;"Power doesn't commit suicide." -&amp;gt; There will obviously be resistance for movement like Occupy.
Institutions currently work to maximize the show term profit and gain. This will eventually lead to destruction of environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="learning-how-to-discover"&gt;Learning how to discover&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Universal grammar is the study of genetic basis for language faculty.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Language faculty was developed quite recently. It's generally plausibly assumed that this happened during "the great leap forward" which is assumed to develop human creative endeavors. What happened should be pretty simple because in evolutionary time scale it happened in the blink of an eye.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is a topic that I digress from Chomsky.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Similar to the "Universal Genome" theory, for language research is going on about universal grammar.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Language is biologically acquired. If you get a baby from australia and being him over to US, he learns perfectly good english.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bulk of the language is learnt before age 2 event though the baby only makes two word sentences.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deaf - Blind people can learn language by placing their hands on the face and throat of other people. P134 - P135 -&amp;gt; Story of a deaf / blind couple who live their life pretty regularly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;"Culture influences and shapes language" -&amp;gt; is a comment but almost meaningless comment. Culture is a general term for everything that goes on. Sure everything that goes on influences language.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vocabulary definitely is influenced from the time and environment. But this generally is trivial like if computer is invented that the people weren't talking about before, you add a word for it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Languist is the one who studies this and linguist is the one who speaks lots of different languages.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In order to make what Chomsky do you need to exercise one muscle, the ability of being puzzled. Why do things happen this way?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gallileo was a dissident of his time. He was denounced by a lot of organizations and people because his ideas were against mainstream. Every society treats dissidents harshly. Also every society is outraged about the harsh treatment of dissidents in the enemy states.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Social solidarity is very dangerous for concentrated power. Facebook / Twitter / etc… makes it easy to organize and keep some connections alive, they contribute to atomization.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;US pioneered the mass public education. One reason is that "Mass population is getting a lot of rights. If they are not properly educated they might come after us." If you have a free education that flames creativity and independence people will still come after you. You need to have an education system that reinforces obedience, acceptance of authority and doctrine.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pretty conspiracist. TED talk from Ken Robinson summarizing the mass educations as the most efficient way to raise workers for the mass manufacturing industry seems more probable. Maybe both :)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;P149 - Proper education is to teach an individual to explore the world in their own creative, individual, independent fashion. Learning how to learn.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;College is very expensive. Infact tuition is getting higher and higher. The result here is that, students are under a lot of debt after the university. Laws are changed so that there is no escape, no bankruptcy. Great technique for indoctrination.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What is the economical reason behind raising the tuition? US is a richer country compared to what it was around 60s when tuition was much more cheap.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;K-12 education and government programs make schools teach children to test. Teachers can't go in independent directions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;P155 - Teacher making his students do things they don't want to do and leading them to raise their questions while teaching American Revolution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="aristocrats-and-democrats"&gt;Aristocrats and Democrats&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bakunin said "A new class of intelligentsia who claims to appropriate all knowledge would move in one of two directions: Red bureaucracy which would make the most oppressive rule ever in the name of the working class or it would recognize that power lies elsewhere, in private capital and become its servants."&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(P174) About Citizens United vs Federal Election Committee which is about the fact that FEC has legalized corporate bribery of our elected officials: There are two aspects here. Tactical aspect and a principled aspect. On the tactical side this case get people interested in itself and get them thinking so it's good. In principle why would corporations have personal rights? They currently have more rights than people of flesh and blood. They are immortal, protected by state power and they are limited liability. I.e. participants are not personally viable say if a company kills 100k people in Bhopal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Also they are directed to maximize their shareholder rights at the expense of stakeholder rights by law. Why?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
