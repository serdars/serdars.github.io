          </h3>
          <article>
            <p>Now that we have an understanding of the five disciplines and their interactions, it is time to look at some implementations of these in big organizations in the world.</p>
            
            <p></p>
            
            <h2 id="foundations">Foundations</h2>
            
            <p>All of the examples we will see below originate from the idea of "growing organizations through growing people" and "creating more reflective work environments where dialogue and inquiring into taken-for-granted mental models are possible".</p>
            
            <p>At BP in order to foster greater cooperation across organizational boundaries, leaders had some ideas but instead of discussing them directly they set up workshops with a diverse set of people across the organization. The ideas they reached were more complex and strong than their original ideas. They also had automatic buy-in since they were created by people across the organization.</p>
            
            <h3 id="reflective-openness">Reflective Openness</h3>
            
            <p>Two different types of openness should be explained: participative (or expressive) and reflective openness. First one is composed of speaking openly about one's views. This is dangerously incomplete for learning organizations. Things like surveys, focus groups are not really effective when people do not reflect into their own work or behavior. They do not surface the kinds of deep and potentially threatening or embarrassing information that motivates true learning and real change. Reflective openness includes looking internally and being open about our internal selves.</p>
            
            <p>Reflective openness is scary for most of the people especially high level managers with traditional view. It is very unlikely to happen in an organization which does not have a deep commitment of helping people grow.</p>
            
            <p>"You have to believe in your heart that people want to pursue a vision that matters, that they want to contribute and be responsible for results and that they are willing to look at shortfalls in their own behavior and correct problems whenever they are able." - Rich Teerlink former CEO of Harley Davidson.</p>
            
            <p>Roca is an organization in Massachusetts. They have applied the dialogue techniques to a low-income community to create a safe and healthy community for young people. In order to be successful gradually they started including people from education system, law enforcement and families over time in their dialogues. They have helped each party to understand the other through dialogue. They core method was based on "showing up for one another" in "peacekeeping circles".</p>
            
            <p>Without individuals reflecting on themselves learning is not possible. So any leadership in learning must start with leaders committing to personal mastery themselves.</p>
            
            <h3 id="organizations-as-living-systems">Organizations as Living Systems</h3>
            
            <p>There are two distinct intellectual traditions behind the systems thinking discipline. 1-) Engineering Theory which tries to understand systems with tools and computer simulations 2-) Increasing the understanding of living systems to make sense of other complex interdependent systems.</p>
            
            <p>Seeing a business as a living system requires us to see it as a human community. Machine image (a machine for making money) is far more common in the modern world. All terminology is based on machine thinking: There are "owners" of the company. Leaders try to "drive change". But we know what happens when we try to "drive" our spouse or our children.</p>
            
            <p>VISA for e.g. does not operate as other companies. It has no publicly traded stock. It is owned by 20k member organizations. It has no large headquarters. It is a network governed by members with a written constitution that spells out the purpose and operating principles. Its founder CEO terms this style of organizing "chaordic" because in nature "order continually emerges from seeming chaos while in management we always try to impose order because we fear that chaos will take over".</p>
            
            <p>Biologist Gregory Bateson says "the source of all problems today comes from the gap between how we think and how actually nature works". Take DNA for example. "We know that in healthy living systems like the human body or wetlands the control is distributed. But the Newtonian inside us puts us into a 'someone must be in control' mindset."</p>
            
            <h2 id="impetus-the-force-or-energy-with-which-a-body-moves">Impetus (the force or energy with which a body moves)</h2>
            
            <p>Building learning oriented cultures is hard work in any setting. First and foremost it requires ourselves to step our comfort zone and stress ourselves by practicing reflective openness. On top of this it has many chances of failing due to the common obstacles any revolutionary change can. Overall there seems to be three overlapping but distinct motivation for building a learning oriented culture:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Seeking a better model for how to manage and lead change.</li>
              <li>Trying to build an adaptive organization.</li>
              <li>Improve performance, productivity and create types of workplaces people would truly like to work.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Change of evolving to a learning oriented culture never comes always after all the parties understand and acknowledge the principles of systems thinking, personal mastery, etcâ€¦ Change always comes by increased reflection, dialogue and distribution of autonomy. This can be achieved by AARs (After Action Reviews or Postmortems), diverse working groups, stating principles rather than prescriptive instructions.</p>
            
            <h2 id="strategies">Strategies</h2>
            
            <p>So how does one strategize in order to get closer to an organization with a learning focus?</p>
            
            <p><img title="Learning Strategy Framework" class="full-width" src="/images/learning-strategy.png" /></p>
            
            <p>This framework has 3 main processes:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Deep Learning Cycle:</strong> : On a deeper level learning is about developing the capacity to reliably produce a certain quality of results. I.e. you cannot declare you've learnt bicycle riding if you only ride a bicycle once. This deep learning process encompasses 5 elements which reinforces each other. For e.g. if people believe the value of real listening, they create "check-in" practice or when people develop dialogue skills, they become more appreciative of the people who depend on them and this strengthens relationships. It is easy to talk about culture as "the way things are". But this process helps us understand different elements of it. The important thing to notice is that, if you change one of these things the others change too albeit slowly.</li>
              <li><strong>Strategy Framework</strong> This framework captures the 3 aspects of a coherent strategy. This point of view originates from "structuration". These three elements are:
                <ul>
                  <li>Guiding Ideas: These are the ideas that accompany the strategy. They are most of the time rooted in governing concepts and principles (as well as purpose, vision and values).</li>
                  <li>Infrastructure Innovations: These include organizational infrastructure changes like formal roles, management structures. They determine how the energy flows in the system.</li>
                  <li>Theory, Tools &amp; Methods: These are the elements people interact with e.g. different meeting styles, postmortems, kanban board, etcâ€¦</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Iteration</strong>: This is the way we model the progression of nature in time. Everything iterates wheter we are conciously act alongside it and decrease the gap between our vision and the current reality. Iterations give us a framework to continuously monitor the gaps we are trying to decrease.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>You can not change how someone thinks, but you can give them a tool, the use of which leads them to think differently</strong> - Buckminister Fuller</p>
            
            <p><strong>We shape our structures and then they shape us.</strong> - Winston Churchill</p>
            
            <p>Based on this conceptual framework, here are the 8 strategies and examples to give a sense of the state of the practical know-how of today:</p>
            
            <h3 id="integrating-learning-and-working">Integrating Learning and Working</h3>
            
            <p>Fragmentation (of learning and working) is the single biggest reason for failure for strategies to promote learning in an organization. Without making practical differences in people's daily work, strategies do not go beyond being an AFP (politely translated as another fine program). The first step is always to appreciate realities of people's work and identify where and how specific learning approaches such as improved reflection can make a practical difference.</p>
            
            <p>A culture that integrates reflection and action, arrives at better decisions (or at least measured decisions) which people can genuinely commit. It also puts people into a more prepared mental state. Having simple protocals like AARs (postmortems) are useful. AARs are composed of 3 questions:</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>What happened?</li>
              <li>What did we expect?</li>
              <li>What can we learn from the gap?</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Generally there are 4 stages to adoption for AARs:</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>Leadership by request and examples.</li>
              <li>Identifying events seen as learning opportunities.</li>
              <li>Grassroots exposure to the AARs (by demonstrating value without mandate without perfection).</li>
              <li>A cadre of trained facilitators.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3 id="starting-where-you-are-with-whoever-is-there">Starting where you are with whoever is there</h3>
            
            <p>Believing there is nothing they can do without the support of "upper management", is a self-defeating principle and the second most common cause of initiatives. One of the executives in the book picks up a few "impossibles" - tasks that people in the company redeem impossible to get done - and attacks them with help of any people he can find. His success is only possible when one is able to tap into people's talents and deepest aspirations.</p>
            
            <h3 id="becoming-bicultural">Becoming Bicultural</h3>
            
            <p>In order to be able to pursue these innovations in a big corporation, one needs to master both the learning oriented culture and traditional culture the organization is in. One of the lessons learnt in the history is that success doesn't always lead to success in organizations. Fundamental innovations with significant leaps can be threathening to other teams. One common way of dealing with this is "stealth transformation" where the thinking behind the actions and the results is available only by request.</p>
            
            <h3 id="creating-practice-fields">Creating Practice Fields</h3>
            
            <p>The simple fact is that it is almost impossible to learn without practice. This strategy makes use of this to create innovative practice fields inside an organization to foster learning. Harley Davidson's way of achieving this is by the concept of "the swirl". Ideas and goals exists either in swirl or on the other side. Passing to the other side is when enough people believed was worth pursuing to make it an organization-wide commitment. Practice fields come in many sizes and shapes. But without them teams are like an orchestra which play for the first time in a performance.</p>
            
            <h3 id="connecting-with-the-core-of-the-business">Connecting with the Core of the Business</h3>
            
            <p>Any initiative's goals should be tied to the core of the business i.e. the aspirations of the deepest level of individual and collective identity. Finding this starts by answering the question "who are we?". Once this is answered via reflection, the next question is how a new vision can tap into the organization's creative process, how new sources of value are generated most naturally in the organization. An example here is Nike which first found the fact that they are innovative by nature and only after that it was able to link the sustainability initiative to innovation in products. Before the answer to the question, sustainability initiative was only able to generate pushed results like (make the product PVC free).</p>
            
            <h3 id="building-learning-communities">Building Learning Communities</h3>
            
            <p>When people pursue the questions that matter the most to them, communities are automatically formed as a by-product. "Social Space" for the community should consciously be created and maintained. But beyond this trying to "drive" or "control" the building process of a community will easily backfire.</p>
            
            <h3 id="working-with-the-other">Working with "The Other"</h3>
            
            <p>Shadow side of the communities are "cults" or "cliques" where people gravitate towards people like themselves. For e.g. internet communities. Since the cost of exit is zero on internet communities, people mostly end up in groups of people like themselves.</p>
            
            <p>Building bridges with traditional non-partners is critical to the diversity of communities. A healthy community is the group in which diversity of ideas exist and it is hold together healthily.</p>
            
            <h3 id="developing-learning-infrastructures">Developing Learning Infrastructures</h3>
            
            <p>Learning infrastructures doesn't leave learning to chance. The pioneer in learning infrastructures is the Army. Army's learning infrastructure includes:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Training and Formal Education: War College, Military Academy</li>
              <li>Practice: Simulations, ARRs, Drills</li>
              <li>Research: Center for Lessons Learned</li>
              <li>Doctrine: Office of Doctrine, Chief Historian</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="about-naming">About Naming</h2>
            
            <p><strong>At the end, like all the new concepts "learning organization" has faddish &amp; post-faddish cycles.</strong> Dr Deming pointed out that TQM, QM or quality management are worthless because they mean whatever people mean by them. It can be or is being similar with the "Learning Organization". "Key lies in our personal journey of reflection, experimentation and becoming more open."</p>
