          </h3>
          <article>
            <p>The final discipline in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Senge">Peter M. Senge's</a> framework is the discipline that brings focus to the in-team social dynamics of Personal Mastery, Shared Vision and Mental Models: Team Learning.</p>
            
            <p></p>
            
            <p>When a group of people come together, the IQ (or a metric that measures the capability of the group) can be a lot higher or a lot lower than the total of the IQs of individuals. Best example of highly functioning teams are <strong>Aligned Teams</strong>. In these teams, in addition to individuals being in the <strong>flow</strong> state, group as a whole is in <strong>flow</strong> state.</p>
            
            <p>In aligned teams, there is a commonality of purpose, shared vision and an understanding of how to complement one another's efforts. Individuals do not sacrifice personal interests to the larger team. Great jazz musicians know and talk about alignment; having a sense of where music is going and how each is contributing to go towards that direction.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Team learning is the discipline of aligning and developing capacity of a team to be able to create the results its members truly desire.</strong> It is a collaborative discipline. It doesn't make sense to say "I'm practicing team learning". It is based on personal mastery and makes use of shared vision and techniques from mental models. It has three critical dimensions:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Being able to think insightfully about complicated situations.</li>
              <li>Coordinated innovative action.</li>
              <li>Role of the team amongst other teams.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Team learning discipline involves mastering the practices of dialogue and discussion, the two distinct ways of conversation. In order to master these practices, a team must first master how to creatively deal with forces opposing productive dialogue and discussions. Lastly like all other disciplines, practice is required to advance in this discipline.</p>
            
            <p>An organization can not become a learning organization unless its teams start treating learning as a discipline.</p>
            
            <h2 id="dialogue-and-discussion">Dialogue and Discussion</h2>
            
            <p>We can all recall having conversations with individuals (friends, family members, colleagues, etc…) which had a high impact on the way we see the world. The idea in dialogue is to have a conversation where the participants can reach a view bigger than the total of their views combined. This is a very old idea practiced in ancient Greek and modern day American Indians. Looks like we have lost this ability on the way (probably due to the self centric view promoted by rationalism).</p>
            
            <p>David Bohm, a leading quantum theorist, asserted that our thought is incoherent and the resulting counter-productiveness is the root cause of all the problems that exist today.</p>
            
            <p>Discussion suggests something like a ping - pong, back and forth. Purpose generally is to <strong>win</strong> and have one's views accepted by the group. You may occasionally accepts other's views to be a part of your own but you want your view to prevail. By contrast dialogue is different. Dia means through and logos means word or meaning. When combined it means "meaning passing through". In dialogue, a group tries to access to the pool of common meaning. In dialogue there is no winning. There is no opposition.</p>
            
            <p><strong>PS:</strong> The idea in dialogue is to have the context that I am not the place where the idea originates from. <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_success_failure_and_the_drive_to_keep_creating?language=en">Elizabeth Gilbert's TED talk</a> is a great theory of how we have started seeing ourselves as the source of creativity and can help when practicing dialogue.</p>
            
            <p>The purpose of the dialogue is to reveal the incoherence of our own thoughts. There are three types of incoherence:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Thought denies that it is participative.</li>
              <li>Thought stops tracking reality and just goes like a program.</li>
              <li>Thought establishes its own frame of reference for solving problems which is the root cause of the problems in the first place.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Consider prejudice. Once a person starts to assume a prototype, prejudice thoughts starts to become an active agent. It participates in the interactions of the person and the prejudiced person. The person can not see how his prejudice shapes what he sees or how he acts. If he can see it, he wouldn't be prejudiced anyways.</p>
            
            <p>Thought presents itself in front of us and pretends that it does not represent. We are actors that forget they are playing a role. Reality may change but the theater continues. <strong>In dialogue participants become observers of their own thinking to let go of the theater and understand the reality better.</strong></p>
            
            <p>People can generally detect when there is a tension in a conversation. What they do right after that is to take a defensive posture and assume that the reason why the tension is popping up is not because of themselves but because of others or the system. Getting defensive triggers more defensiveness in the other participants and conversation quickly escalates into a discussion without control.</p>
            
            <p><strong>If our collective thinking is an ongoing stream, thoughts are leaves floating on the surface. We experience them as thoughts. We misperceive that they are ours because we fail to see the stream of collective thinking from which they arise.</strong></p>
            
            <p>The main idea is not some theoretical pure definition of dialogue but develop our skills that will make us recognize our more and more of our incoherences. There are three principle elements of a dialogue.</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>All participants mus <strong>suspend their assumptions</strong> and hold them in front of themselves.</li>
              <li>All participants must <strong>regard one another as colleagues</strong>.</li>
              <li>There must be a <strong>facilitator</strong> who
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>holds the context</strong> of the dialogue.</li>
                  <li><strong>artfully diminishes the resistance</strong> to the dialogue.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3 id="suspending-assumptions">Suspending Assumptions</h3>
            
            <p>The idea is to realize your assumptions and hold your assumptions to external observation in order to correct them. There is nothing wrong with having assumptions (or thoughts) let them be right or wrong. The problematic part is to hold on to them without being aware of holding on to them.</p>
            
            <p>This can not be done when you are trying to defend a position. The mind by its nature wants to keep moving away from holding assumptions to adopting non-negotiatable and rigid opinions which we then feel compelled to defend.</p>
            
            <p>Suspending assumptions is a lot like detecting <strong>Leaps of Abstraction</strong> and <strong>inquirying into the reasoning behind the abstractions</strong>. In dialogue this suspension should be done collectively. There is a reinforcing process here when more people start to suspend assumptions, the more suitable the environment is for dialogue and the more people start to suspend assumptions.</p>
            
            <h3 id="seeing-each-other-as-colleagues">Seeing each other as Colleagues</h3>
            
            <p>Seeing each other as colleagues is vital to creating a positive tone and vulnerability. Hierarchy is especially problematic to this since people will by definition be in a defensive stance when they see the others as their bosses or decision makers in a conversation.</p>
            
            <p>Being colleagues doesn't mean sharing the same view. In fact the diversity of views is healthy in dialogue. It is also more easier to carry a dialogue when there are not a diversity of opinions. When there is conflict it is tougher to suspend assumptions and treat each other as colleagues.</p>
            
            <h3 id="facilitator">Facilitator</h3>
            
            <p>We are worried to suspend our assumptions and display them publicly. We have a habitual thinking that these assumptions form our identity and we are really worried about others detecting some errors in our identity. After all we don't want to lose our identity or as we know of it.</p>
            
            <p>A skilled facilitator has many duties in a dialogue:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Ensuring people own the ownership of the process and outcomes. When people start saying "so-and-so won't let us talk about this" or "this is the way it is" facilitator brings the conversation back.</li>
              <li>Ensures that dialogue doesn't turn into a discussion. Individuals might want to convert the dialogue into discussion without being aware of it.</li>
              <li>Is in a fine line being the knowledgable and helpful in the process yet not taking the expert or doctor mantle that would shift the attention away from team members.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>But he does this all and influences the flow of development only by participating. For e.g. after someone making an observation the facilitator might way "But the opposite may also be true" to remind of other possibilities.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The artistry of the dialogue lies in experiencing the flow of meaning and seeing the one thing that needs to be said now.</strong></p>
            
            <p>As teams practice dialogue more and more, the need for a facilitator decreases. Dialogue emerges from leaderless groups once the members have developed the skill and understanding for the need.</p>
            
            <h3 id="balancing-dialogue--discussion">Balancing Dialogue &amp; Discussion</h3>
            
            <p>A team needs both dialogue and discussion in order to effectively function.</p>
            
            <p>Dialogue is used when different ideas are presented towards discovering a new view on a situation. Discussion is used when team needs to reach a decision. Before agreements and decisions, discussions are a necessity. Dialogue is divergent where discussions are convergent.</p>
            
            <p>An effective team knows when to use dialogue and when to use discussion. A special relationship develops amongst the team members who regularly enter dialogue. They develop a richer understanding of uniqueness of each person's point of view and more they understand how larger understandings emerge from holding one's own point of view gently. <strong>They learn how to hold a position without being hold by their positions.</strong> Skills used for dialogue help in having a better discussion.</p>
            
            <h3 id="reflection-inquiry--dialogue">Reflection, Inquiry &amp; Dialogue</h3>
            
            <p>Dialogue that is rooted in reflection and inquiry is more reliable and resistant to the special circumstances of the situations.</p>
            
            <p>Generally there are two types of consensus. 1-) Focusing down or common denominator 2-) Focusing up.</p>
            
            <p>Second builds from the fact that we can see a different thing when we look at the reality from someone else's view. This is true for other looking through our view as well. When combined via dialogue, this leads to coming up with a view that is greater than all of our views combined.</p>
            
            <h2 id="conflict-and-defensive-routines">Conflict and Defensive Routines</h2>
            
            <p>In great teams conflict is productive. In fact, the essence of "visioning" lies in a set of ideas emerging from a set of conflicting ideas. In mediocre teams, conflict represents itself in one of two forms: Either there is an appearance of no conflict in the surface or there is rigid polarization. Managers speak out in polarized teams and no one speaks out in hidden conflict teams.</p>
            
            <p>Defensive routines are habits we've acquired over time supported by a set of mental models that we use to protect ourselves form embarrassment and threat that come with exposing our own thinking. <strong>Defensive reasoning protects us from learning the validity of our reasoning.</strong> Because we are afraid that people will find errors in it.</p>
            
            <p>Defensive routines are so diverse and commonplace that we usually do not notice them. "That's a very interesting idea" when we don't have any intention to entertain the idea, deliberately squash an idea in order to avoid having to consider it, etc… Generally the individual in which the defensive routine is operating is not aware of it. In fact if it is not hidden, it wouldn't be operative.</p>
            
            <p>Deep within the mental models of managers in an organization, is the belief that <strong>managers must know what is going on</strong>. Those that reach senior positions are masters at appearing to know what is going on and those intent to reach high develop an air of confident knowledge early in their career.</p>
            
            <p>Managers in this state of mind find themselves in one of two binds. 1-) Some internalize the air of confidence and they simply believe that they know the answers to most important problems but to protect their beliefs they must close themselves to alternative views and make themselves un-influenceable. They must be rigid in order to appear confident. 2-) Some believe they are expected to know what is causing the important problems but deep down recognize that they don't. They maintain a facade of confidence to obscure their ignorance. Whichever the bind managers find themselves in, they become highly skillful in defensive routines that preserve the aura as capable decision makers by not revealing the thinking behind their decisions.</p>
            
            <p>Defensiveness most of the time becomes an accepted part of organizational culture. <strong>We are the carriers of defensive routines and the organizations are the hosts. Once infected, they too become the carriers.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Defensive routines are a response to a problem. The problem is a need to learn arising from a "learning gap". Fundamental solution is inquiry that results eventually in a new understanding and new behavior that is learning. Symptomatic solution is to employ the defensive routine by reducing the "percieved need for learning".</p>
            
            <p>The more effective defensive routines are, the more effectively they cover up the underlying problems, the less problems are seen and the worse they become. The effective defensive routines are also ••self-sealing**. They obscure their own existence. Thanks to the societal norms, it is not good to expose or even acknowledge that we are being defensive.</p>
            
            <p>As in all shifting the burden structures, there are two leverages. 1-) Weaken the symptomatic solution. In this case by weakening the emotional threat one faces for which the defensive routine is employed for. 2-) Strengthening the fundamental solution. In this case by inquiring into the problem.</p>
            
            <p>But how to make them discussable is a challenge. If you expose another person's defensive routine in a public setting, it for sure is going to backfire. Skillful managers learn to confront defensiveness without producing more defensiveness.</p>
            
            <p>They do so by self-disclosure and but inquiring into the causes of their own defensiveness. "I notice that I'm feeling threatened by this new proposal. Can you help me see where this uneasiness is coming from?"</p>
            
            <p>In the presence of a genuinely shared vision, defensive routines become just another aspect of current reality, like the structural conflicts raised during personal mastery. They are in fact useful signals for spotting the times when learning is not happening and especially difficult and important issues. They drain the energy of the team and create a feeling of powerlessness in achieving the vision.</p>
            
            <p>It is not the absence of defensiveness that characterizes the learning teams, but what happens when the defensiveness is faced. A team that is committed to truth doesn't only talk about what is happening out there but also talks about what is happening in here.</p>
            
            <h2 id="practice">Practice</h2>
            
            <p>Practice is the missing link to build the discipline of team learning. Great orchestrates, bands, sport teams all practice before the day of play. But for us practicing is really not super practical. Great teams are the ones who stay together for a long time and continuously practice. Creative advertising teams for example stick together most of the time. They even change the companies as a team.</p>
            
            <p>Beyond the practicing of making a decision, creating the environment and time to step back and reflect on the process of making a decision is necessary in learning. [Slack concept in Kanban]</p>
            
            <p>For future reference, the necessary conditions of a dialogue session are:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Having all members of the team together.</li>
              <li>Explaining the 3 ground rules (add more as needed)</li>
              <li>Enforcing the ground rules so that team acknowledges when someone finds himself not dialoguing but discussing.</li>
              <li>Making it possible, indeed encouraging, for team members to raise the most difficult, subtle and conflictual issues essential to team's work.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="team-learning-and-the-fifth-discipline">Team Learning and The Fifth Discipline</h2>
            
            <p>Systems Thinking most importantly helps practicing team learning. The first help of it is because it helps us to view the conflicts in a whole way without excluding ourselves from them which helps for us to suspend our assumptions.</p>
            
            <p>The biggest help of it all is by giving as a language to talk about our problems. There are many benefits of having a language to talk about complexity and defensive routines:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Helps us reach to a common understanding of complexity.</li>
              <li>Helps us dedicate time to talking about complexity.</li>
              <li>Visualize our emotions and helps us able to resolve emotional conflicts more easily.</li>
              <li>Help us get to a common understanding by inquiring into our thinking.</li>
              <li>Create a friendly environment by making it easy to talk about defensive routines.</li>
