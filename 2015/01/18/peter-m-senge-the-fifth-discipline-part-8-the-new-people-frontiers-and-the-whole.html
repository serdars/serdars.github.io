          </h3>
          <article>
            <p>In the newly painted picture of a learning organization what does it mean to be a leader or what does it mean to be working for such an organization.</p>
            
            <p></p>
            
            <p>In the SoL's workshops one of the surprising findings were that "People have no real comprehension of the type of commitment that is required to build such an organization". During one of the chats, one of the teachers asked one of the students (a person who succeeded in setting up a learning organization): "Mieko, when did it shift for you?". Most of the people in the room didn't understand what he meant by that. But to the student the question was clear. As the answer she told a story about her interaction with a mother and her soon to be dead child in Africa because of poverty. She said: "I knew that this little girl didn't need to die. That is when it shifted for me."</p>
            
            <h3 id="what-does-leader-mean">What does "Leader" mean?</h3>
            
            <p><strong>To become a leader, you must first become a human being. - Confucius</strong></p>
            
            <p>In all historical accounts "wisdom" is the oldest idea that is associated with leadership. This view is pretty much lost today. We should note that "Senior Management", "Executive Managers" are not always "Leaders". There are different types of leaders in an organization:</p>
            
            <p>Local line leaders are vital for integrating innovative practices into daily work. Without them it is impossible to translate any idea however effective it is into actions.</p>
            
            <p>Network leaders are helpers, seed carriers and connectors. They often work closely with local line leaders to build local capacity and integrating new practices. They are vital for spreading ideas and practices from one group to another. They build larger networks that diffuse successful innovations, important learning and knowledge.</p>
            
            <p>Executive leaders shape the overall environment for innovation and change.They lead in developing guiding ideas for the enterprise as a whole. They are not the source of these ideas but it is their responsibility to ensure existence of uplifting ideas.</p>
            
            <p>Each of these type of leaders needs the others.</p>
            
            <p>Our traditional views of leaders -especially in the west- are based on seeing them as heroes, great people who "rise to the fore" in times of crisis and do that noone else could do. This view at its heart is based on the assumption of people's powerlessness and their lack of personal vision and inability to master the forces of change.</p>
            
            <p>The new view of leadership centers on 3 subtler more important tasks:</p>
            
            <h3 id="leader-as-designer">Leader as Designer</h3>
            
            <p>On a ship, one usually sees the captain as the leader of the ship or sometimes the navigator is seen as the leader since he sets the direction. The most neglected aspect of leadership belongs to the designer of the ship.</p>
            
            <p>When we translate the design from a physical system to a social system, we face with a challenge. We cannot seperate ourselves from the system. It would be tempting to see the system outside of us as a separate thing but this is not the reality.</p>
            
            <p>Leader as a designer, understands that they can create artifacts (like metrics, roles, processes) but what matters is what happens when people use the artifacts.</p>
            
            <p>Learning infrastructures never emerge wholly formed. They always develop overtime. So they always need to start with the willingness to experiment. The final state that emerges is the least important because people learn to learn during iterations of achieving that form.</p>
            
            <p><strong>This is even true for the guiding ideas of vision, mission and values. Never show up with the fully baked cake. Bake the cake together with the people. Be prepared because it will take longer to bake the cake with people. And remember cake that comes out is not important in itself. It's not what the vision is, it's what the vision does.</strong></p>
            
            <p><strong>The wicked leader is he whom the people revile</strong></p>
            
            <p><strong>The good leader is he whom the people revere</strong></p>
            
            <p><strong>The great leader is he of whom the people say, "We did it ourselves."</strong></p>
            
            <p><strong>â€“ Lao Tzu</strong></p>
            
            <h3 id="leader-as-teacher">Leader as Teacher</h3>
            
            <p>A great teacher is someone around whom others learn. Great teachers create space for learning and invite people into that space. Less masterful teachers focus on what they are teaching and how they are doing it.</p>
            
            <p>Robert Greenleaf identified "the desire to serve" as the core motivation for great leaders and "the growth of people" as the chief indicator of such leaders. He called them "servant leaders": "The best test is: Do those served grow as a person? Do they become healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, more likely themselves to become servants?"</p>
            
            <p>Leader's work as teacher becomes with identifying an important capacity that is lacking in the organization. They don't try to solve this problem and teach to the rest of the organization. They get people together and enable people fill the gap.</p>
            
            <p>The core task of the leader as a teacher is to empower view of current reality, i.e. help people see the current reality as it is. Most of the time people are all buried in the day-to-day hassles of the job. Helping them see the underlying systemic structures is a direct way to empower them and surface the current reality.</p>
            
            <p>But on the way to teach people systems thinking (or any other difficult new skill), one always faces a dilemma. One can not simply explain the concept and expect people to learn it and use it. One needs to make mistakes or to be shown the correct way before internalizing a learning. The most optimal way to teach is to connect "event driven systems thinking" to "developmental systems thinking".</p>
            
            <p>One example in the book that explains this idea is the group who cuts the IT budget without sharing the systemic thinking they are doing with the rest of the company. It might feel manipulative but sharing it will not help their cause at all.</p>
            
            <p><strong>To be a true teacher, you must be a learner first.</strong> Indeed teacher's own passion for learning inspires the students as much as their expertise.</p>
            
            <h3 id="leader-as-steward">Leader as Steward</h3>
            
            <p>According to Greenleaf, one needs to be a servant first and conscious choice inspires him to be a leader. That is stewardship is always to something larger (personal vision).</p>
            
            <p>Servant leaders eventually face two paradoxes:</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Certainty &amp; Commitment:</strong> Eric Hoffer in his book decribes the thing that separates the "fanatic" from "committed" people is "certainty". Fanatic is certain that he is right. Genuine commitment always co-exists with some element of questioning and uncertainty.</li>
              <li><strong>Conservation &amp; Change:</strong> Leader's focus is to always bring about a different order of things. They always focus on the new and emergent. At the same time they try to conserve the core of the organism since it is the key to enabling change.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>These two paradoxes fill the life of a leader with doubt and fear. Thinking these on their own keeping a clear answer to them in our minds can help leaders reduce the extra load.</p>
            
            <p>The enemy of the steward leaders is ambition. Top of the organizations are covered with networks of ambition. This is one potential reason why the number of women at the top is low because they are more likely to say "Screw you guys I'm going home" when there is no larger purpose. But as ambition hits the worlds limits, sustainability is becoming more and more important for global organizations.</p>
            
            <p>Leaders are stewards of their own personal vision. And they inspire others around them to be the same. We most of the time forget this when we have children. This is a great analogue to the <strong>special sense of responsibility without possesiveness</strong> we need to develop for our visions.</p>
            
            <h3 id="how-to-build-such-leaders">How to build such Leaders?</h3>
            
            <p>Common development approaches the author has seen working with many leaders is being committed to their own development, having a strong sense of personal vision and just "struggling to become a human being".</p>
            
            <p>Leadership is an assessment made by others. People who are truly leading very rarely think of themselves that way. As David Packard described "Bill and I were just doing what we loved and were so delighted that people wanted to join us."</p>
            
            <h3 id="systems-citizens">Systems Citizens</h3>
            
            <p>After the near light speed development of human specie on earth, we are starting to face large scale problems that we have not met and evolved to face yet. In order to solve these problems we need to start seeing the systems that we have shaped and which in turn shape us.</p>
            
            <p>There are two fundamental aspects of seeing systems: seeing the patterns of interdependency and seeing into the future. Once people truly see the systemix pattern that they have created and comprehend the suffering it will create in the future; they invariably discover ways to change the pattern.</p>
            
            <p>It is easy to get lost in thinking about the global issues like climate change and feel that there is nothing we can do or anyone can do. But global systems are not just global, we live inside them. System is not out there. It is in here. A great example is included in the book of a Ford executive who goes to a fuel cell company and converts that company from a tech company to a company with a mission.</p>
            
            <p>Supply Networks is another example. Food supply network that we are making use of is developed to make food cheaper for rich people and push poor people to produce more food in order to earn more money which in turn decreases the price of food and amount of money they earn. <a href="http://www.sustainablefoodlab.org/">Sustainable Food Lab</a> is an effort started in Brazil with inclusion of different parties as a practice field to see how the system can be influenced.</p>
            
            <p>There are many other examples like Saudi Arabia's efforts to lift the standards of their poor people.</p>
            
            <h3 id="frontiers">Frontiers</h3>
            
            <p>The simple definition of learning that SoL network had been using is "a process of enhancing learners' capacity, individually and collectively, to produce results they truly want to produce". Couple of important points aobut this definition: 1-) it argues for building capacity for effective action instead of intellectual action 2-) the fact that this capacity build over time, usually considerable time. (I think the fact that personal vision is strongly signalled should be the third great point.)</p>
            
            <p>There are many great examples and great stories. One important theme is that in most of these stories the new type of leaders (as it happens with any novel idea) emerges from the peripherals, like women, youth, rural communities.</p>
            
            <p>Most of the people who successfully start chasing their true personal vision go through 3 openings. Opening of head, the heart and the will.</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Opening of Head</strong>: This step helps us see and hear what is in front of us. E.g. suspending taken-for-granted assumptions.</li>
              <li><strong>Seeing with Heart</strong>: This is the step where we open to see our connection to the things and people around us.</li>
              <li><strong>Opening of Will</strong>: Letting whatever may arise come through us.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p><strong>If you can achieve real innocence in what you do, become truly insignificant in the sense that you are not trying to lay claim to it for yourself or trying to be recognized for the outcome -and that is very tough to do- gifts arrive. They make take the form of influence, of strength, of will, of a sense of purpose, of energy or just all sorts of things happening that aid the cause.</strong></p>
            
            <h3 id="the-indivisible-whole">The Indivisible Whole</h3>
            
            <p>When one of the astronauts joined one of the SoL workshops, he described his experience of seeing the world from the space with a lot of difficulty. <strong>Gaia</strong> the idea that the biosphere, all life on earth, is itself a living organism helped him.</p>
            
            <p>He said that even tough he was seeing the world, he was seeing it as an extension of all the life in earth.</p>
            
            <p>"Something new is happening. And it has to do with it all - the whole."</p>
