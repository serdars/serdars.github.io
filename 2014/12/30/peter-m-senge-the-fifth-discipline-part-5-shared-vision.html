          </h3>
          <article>
            <p>The best example of Shared Vision is when Marcus Crassus gives the slaves the chance to save their lives if they give away Spartacus. Each and every one of the slaves respond with "I'm the Spartacus" since they are loyal to the shared vision of freedom Spartacus has inspired in them.</p>
            
            <p></p>
            
            <p>Shared Vision is at its simplest form the answer to the question "What do we want to create?". Just as everyone carries their personal vision as pictures for themselves, shared vision is the picture each member of a group carries in their minds for their group. It is formed when members of a group have similar pictures in their minds and when they are committed to having that picture not just for themselves but together. They derive power from their deep caring for the vision.</p>
            
            <h2 id="why-shared-vision-matters">Why Shared Vision matters?</h2>
            
            <p>None of the big accomplishments in the history was possible without a shared vision amongst a group of people. This triggered a big push in corporate leadership to come up with a "vision" for their companies. But many of the vision statements produced are nothing more than just words. They are mostly extrinsic. They focus on achieving something relative to an outsider, like beating a competitor or achieving highest market share. When a vision is only extrinsic, it can't create genuine excitement.</p>
            
            <p>An intrinsic shared vision uplifts people's aspirations. They become part of a larger purpose, which subconsciously every person desires. Organization is no longer "their company". It becomes "our company". It incites courage in individuals and moves them past <strong>compliance</strong> into <strong>commitment</strong>. It fosters risk taking and experimentation.</p>
            
            <p>Most importantly it incites <strong>long term focus</strong>. For years organizations and individuals theorized how to keep long term focus rather than giving into short term gains. <strong>It is simply not possible to convince human being rationally to take a long term view.</strong> People do not focus on the long term when they have to. They only focus on it when they want to.</p>
            
            <p>Shared Vision extends the principles of personal mastery into the world of collective aspirations and shared commitment.</p>
            
            <h3 id="how-to-create-a-shared-vision">How to create a Shared Vision?</h3>
            
            <p><strong>Shared Visions emerge from personal visions.</strong> A group's shared vision can not be solely the personal vision of its founder. It can start there but one can't apply his personal vision to the group. Many leaders forget this and mix their personal vision and the shared vision of their group. The result in this case is <strong>compliance</strong> not <strong>commitment</strong>. In order to develop a shared vision, personal mastery is a requirement. Each member's personal vision provides the bedrock for the shared vision. The art of visionary leadership is building a shared vision from personal visions.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Shared Vision is not a photograph but a hologram.</strong> When you cut a photograph into pieces, each piece shows only part of the whole image. But for a hologram even the smallest piece captures the whole image intact. In each piece the whole image is represented even though slightly differently. When you add all the pieces you get the whole image but more intense and more lifelike.</p>
            
            <p>The first step to create a shared vision is to let go the traditional vision concept that comes down from up high in an organization. These efforts are most of the time a single effort to describe and overarching strategical direction to the company, they do not come alive. Second problem with these efforts is the fact that they are not build on individual's personal visions. Finally vision is not a solution to a problem. It is the central daily work of leaders.</p>
            
            <p>This is not to say that shared vision can not come from up high. They most of the time do. But some level of "bubbling up" from down below is always part of the process. Leadership must be careful not to assume that their personal visions become organization's vision when they assume a position of leadership. They mistakenly word "my vision" as "our vision". They should remember Mark Twain's suggestion that <strong>The use of word "we" should be reserved for kings and people with tapeworm.</strong></p>
            
            <h3 id="spreading-vision---commitment-vs-compliance">Spreading Vision - Commitment vs Compliance</h3>
            
            <p>Spreading of vision is not about giving inspiring speeches and inspiring the troops. It is about solving the daily problems with the vision in mind. The process is same whether the vision originates in the middle or at the top.</p>
            
            <p>Today it is very common to hear managers talking about "getting buy in" or "selling" around the vision. Yet there is a world of difference between <strong>selling</strong> and <strong>enrolling</strong>. Selling means getting someone to do something that he might not do if he were in full possession of all facts. Enrolling, by contrast, literally means placing one's name on the roll.</p>
            
            <p>Enrollment is the process of becoming part of something by choice. You are committed when you enroll. People enroll in social causes out of genuine desire and once a year they make a donation. But when they are committed the cause can count on them. They will do whatever it takes to make the vision real. In today's organizations, relatively low number of people are enrolled and even fewer are committed.</p>
            
            <p>Great majority are in a state of compliance. There are multiple levels of compliance which makes it difficult to differentiate enrollment and commitment from compliance:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Commitment</strong>: Wants it. Will make it happen. Creates any "laws" that are needed.</li>
              <li><strong>Enrollment</strong>: Wants it. Will do whatever can be done within the "spirit of the law".</li>
              <li><strong>Genuine Compliance</strong>: Sees the benefit of the vision. Does everything expected and more. Follows the "letter of the law". "Good soldier"</li>
              <li><strong>Formal Compliance</strong>: On the whole sees the benefit of the vision. Does what is expected and no more. "Pretty good soldier"</li>
              <li><strong>Grudging Compliance</strong>: Does not see the benefit of the vision. Also doesn't want to lose the job. Does enough of what's expected because he has to but also lets it be known that he is not really on board.</li>
              <li><strong>Noncompliance</strong>: Does not see the benefit of the vision and will not do what is expected. "I won't do it, you can't make me".</li>
              <li><strong>Apathy</strong>: Neither for nor against the vision. No interest. No energy. "Is it five o'clock yet?"</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Great way to think about it is using the speed limits. Genuinely compliant will never drive over the speed limit. Formally compliant will drive 5 - 7 miles over the speed limit because you will not get a ticket in most states when you do so. Grudgingly compliant will drive the same speed and continuously complain about it. Noncompliant driver will not care about the limit and do everything possible to avoid troopers. Committed person would drive that speed even if it was not the legal limit.</p>
            
            <p>In most organizations formal and genuine compliance go "along with the program". Noncompliance or grudging compliance usually stands out since they let their opposition be known. Most problematic case is genuine compliance often mistaken for enrollment or commitment. They will do what is expected of them willingly. They also think they are committed. And they are but only to "being part of the team". These people also caress the egos of leaders if they are into it.</p>
            
            <p>Couple things that should be noted is that, some people have been never asked to commit to anything for themselves. They should be approached with gentleness. Also commitment should be gentle not to infringe the independence of the individual. After all individuals should first be committed to a personal vision, second to the shared vision which emancipates from the personal vision.</p>
            
            <h3 id="guidelines-for-enrollment--commitment">Guidelines for Enrollment &amp; Commitment</h3>
            
            <p>In order to incite enrollment:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Be enrolled yourself. Don't sell to get to superficial agreement since it sows the seeds for future resentment.</li>
              <li>Be on the level. Do not inflate benefits or sweep problems under the rug.</li>
              <li>Let the other person choose. Have a willingness for making the individual free to choose.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>There are many times when we need compliance. In these situations it is better to be open about it. "I know you do not wholeheartedly agree but decision is made and we need your support in getting through this".</p>
            
            <h3 id="anchoring-vision-in-governing-ideas">Anchoring Vision in Governing Ideas</h3>
            
            <p>Building a shared vision is one part of the activity of building the governing ideas for an enterprise: vision, purpose or mission and core values.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Vision: What? The picture we seek to create.</li>
              <li>Purpose or Mission: Why? Why do we exist?</li>
              <li>Core Values: How? How do we want to act? How do we want life to be on a day-to-day basis?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Taken together, they answer the question "What do we believe in?". People have a genuine need to be part of an ennobling mission or purpose. But it is abstract. Vision makes the purpose more concrete as a guiding star.</p>
            
            <p>Note that "What do we want to create?" is different than "What do we want to avoid?". Negative visions are more common in today's organizations but they are limiting for 3 reasons:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Energy for building something is directed to preventing something else.</li>
              <li>They carry a subtle message of powerlessness. We only pull together against a threat.</li>
              <li>They are inevitably short term. They are not applicable once the thread disappears.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>The power of human beings is to organize against a generative purpose instead of a reactive purpose such as threat to survival.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Similar to personal mastery, effectiveness of an organization is based on how they <strong>hold</strong> the creative tension, i.e. their vision while remaining committed to current reality.</p>
            
            <h2 id="shared-vision-and-systems-thinking">Shared Vision and Systems Thinking</h2>
            
            <p>Shared Vision operates in a reinforcing process of "people talking about the vision and pursuing the vision", "clarity of shared vision" and "enthusiasm toward vision". But there are many limiting processes that can derail this cycle.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Inability to inquire and harmonize opinion diversity:</strong> "people talking about the vision and pursuing the vision" eventually leads to "diversity of views", "conflicting visions" and "polarization" which decreases the "clarity of shared vision". The limiting factor in this process is lacking the ability to inquire and harmonize different opinions hence the leverage. Do people feel that the vision is set in stone? Must those who doesn't agree with the vision change their views? Do people feel their own visions do not matter? If answer to any of these questions is yes, this process is active. Hologram aspect of shared visions should be protected. The most effective way to do this is to utilize the inquiry skills used to surface out our mental models.</li>
              <li><strong>Capacity to hold Creative Tension</strong>: Visions also die because of the apparent difficulty in bringing the vision into reality. "clarity of shared vision" leads to "perceived gap between vision and current reality", "discouragement" (emotional tension) and decreases the "enthusiasm toward vision". This is why personal mastery and the ability to hold creative tension is the bedrock to develop a shared vision.</li>
              <li><strong>Time required for current reality</strong>: This process is a limiting factor which results from "people talking about the vision and pursuing the vision" to "time required for developing vision", "time available for vision", "focus on vision" and "decrease in clarity of shared vision". Leverage is in finding ways to focus less time and effort on ongoing crises and managing the current reality.</li>
              <li><strong>Time pressure or ability to inquire into vision</strong>: When people start talking about vision, they start proselytizing (religiously converting each other) in order to settle down and have clarity on the vision. "enthusiasm toward vision" leads to "proselytizing", "decrease in quality of relationships" and decrease in "enthusiasm toward vision". The leverage in this process is to keep individual's relationship to vision either with time or skills. In order to keep our fragile relationship we need to respect one another otherwise we will get separated into insider (true believers) and outsiders of the vision.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Systems Thinking brings the missing synergy when talking about the vision. It gives us the framework not to feel powerlessness against the external factor. It provides people a language to speak about otherwise unspoken interrelationships and keep the optimism and the generative drive towards clarifying and reaching our vision step by step.</p>
