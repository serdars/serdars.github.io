          </h3>
          <article>
            <p>One of the most important topics in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Senge">Peter M. Senge's</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Fifth-Discipline-Practice-Organization/dp/0553456342">The Fifth Discipline</a>: Personal Mastery.</p>
            
            <p></p>
            
            <p>Personal Mastery is the discipline of personal growth and learning. It is a generative activity. It covers the acquisition and development of competencies and skills but goes beyond it. It requires spiritual unfolding but it is more than that. At its core, it is composed of doing only two things:</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>Continuously clarifying what is important to us</li>
              <li>Clearly seeing current reality as it is</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Sadly "mastery" word has bad connotations associated with it. In this context it doesn't suggest dominance over other things in life. A great example is John Petrucci. He is a great master but he doesn't dominate guitar.</p>
            
            <p>In order to continually clarify what is important to us, our personal vision, we need to learn more and more about ourselves. In order to learn more about ourselves we need to learn to be able to see the reality clearly. The clear we see the reality, we clear we can define what is really important for us. This is a reinforcing process based on learning.</p>
            
            <p>Learning in this sense doesn't mean acquiring more information. It is incorporating any information we acquire in our lives in order to expand our ability to produce results we would like to achieve. It is a never ending life long process.</p>
            
            <p>For a person with high level of personal mastery:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Personal Vision is a calling rather than simply a good idea.</li>
              <li>They see the current reality as an ally, not an enemy.</li>
              <li>They work with the existing forces rather than resist them.</li>
              <li>They feel part of a larger creative process that they can influence but can not unilaterally control.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Why do we want personal mastery? As an organization, if the people working in the organization are committed to continuously improving themselves, this is in the interest of the organization. The happy people produce happy projects. As an individual we want it because we want it. Who doesn't want to achieve the thing they want most in life?</p>
            
            <p>Organizations however sometimes resist personal mastery. Main reason is that, it is not easily quantifiable also sometimes due to cynicism. In order to fight cynicism, one needs to undestand the source of it. Most of the times it is due to a trauma one experienced. And lastly resistance comes from fear which is the primary blocker of learning.</p>
            
            <p>Approaching personal vision as a means to organization's goal devalues the relationship between the individual and the organization. Goal should be to create covenantal relationships rather than contractuals ones.</p>
            
            <h2 id="personal-vision">Personal Vision</h2>
            
            <p>Personal Vision comes from within. Most of the times we have goals and objectives but no real vision. Most of the time goals point to things that we want to get rid of (aversion) in our lives. Let's use <strong>negative vision</strong> as a term for these tendencies.</p>
            
            <p>Another subtler form to watch out for is "focusing on the means not the result". This generally creates <strong>diminished vision</strong>. Part of our vision is high market share. But why? In order to be more profitable. But why?</p>
            
            <p><code>The ability to focus on ultimate intrinsic desires, not only secondary goals, is a cornerstone of personal mastery.</code></p>
            
            <p>The vision can not be talked about without a purpose in life. Regardless of the ontological answer to this question, life's purpose is a useful concept to use. Purpose is similar to a direction, a general heading. Vision is a specific destination. Purpose is abstract. Vision is concrete. Vision without an underlying purpose is just a good idea. Purpose without a vision has no sense of appropriate scale.</p>
            
            <p>Ultimately vision is intrinsic, not relative. It is desired for its intrinsic value. It is multi-dimensional. There is material aspects, how much money we want to have; service facets, helping others; etc… All are part of what we truly want.</p>
            
            <p>In order to develop a personal vision, one needs to approach it as a discipline and clear it constantly.</p>
            
            <p>For a person with high level of personal mastery:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Is courageous enough to take a stand for his vision.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="creative-tension">Creative Tension</h2>
            
            <p>The gap between the current reality and the vision creates tension. Because we would like to resolve this gap. Not being able to resolve it quickly leads to two potential cases. If we're holding onto our vision strong enough it creates energy, a.k.a. creative tension, to pull us forward. If not, it creates emotional tension that pulls us back. Pretty much all the times we experience both.</p>
            
            <p>We should be mindful when holding the creative tension. It can be reduced in two ways. 1-) lowering the vision. 2-) Getting closer to the vision. 2 is always harder than 1. We <strong>shift the burden</strong> by symptomatic solutions in order to reduce the emotional tension (not thinking about our vision or lowering the vision).</p>
            
            <h2 id="failure">Failure</h2>
            
            <p>It is not about what the vision is, it is more about what the vision does. E.g. Head of Xerox R &amp; D had the vision to revolutionize the education system by having devices for students and teachers. But he ended up creating PC. Did he fail? NBA player who was the MVP 12 / 13 times in his team used to watch himself after every match and rate his play. His maximum score in his career was 65. Did he fail?</p>
            
            <p>Failure is an evidence of gap between current reality and vision. Opportunity for learning. They are not about unworthiness or powerlessness.</p>
            
            <p>Mastery of Creative Tension, builds patience and perseverance. This changes the approach to failures. The more clear picture of the current reality we can get to, the more clearly we can understand how we can reach our vision.</p>
            
            <h2 id="structural-conflict">Structural Conflict</h2>
            
            <p>Structural Conflicts are byproducts of our emotional tension due to the gap between current reality and vision. The most two common underlying emotions that it triggers are powerlessness and unworthiness for the vision.</p>
            
            <p>We employ 3 habitual strategies to address structural conflicts:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Erode the vision.</li>
              <li>Conflict manipulation: Avoiding, negative vision, …</li>
              <li>Willpower: Pushing our way through the conflict. Has very small leverage.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Author faces a situation where the people continuously let him down during the critical time in the projects. He willpowers his way through the project with the mental model that people always let other people down. Once the conflict is recognized he can develop coping strategies by setting better goals, reducing the pressure on people etc… We should be aware that we can't make the choice to change unless we are aware of our current reality.</p>
            
            <p>Pretty much all of us develop these responses through our development and experiences. In order to change these habitual responses, we need to change our sub-conscious beliefs that we are unworthy of our vision or powerless to achieve that vision.</p>
            
            <p>So where is the leverage?</p>
            
            <h2 id="commitment-to-the-truth">Commitment to the Truth</h2>
            
            <p>The way to change any underlying belief is being committed to the truth. (Same idea that meditators reached and explained a little further long time ago)</p>
            
            <p>Commitment to the Truth, doesn't mean seeking the absolute final word or ultimate cause. It is the relentless effort to understand structures underlying the events in the world and in ourselves.</p>
            
            <p>A person with high level of personal mastery:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>See more of the structural conflicts underlying their own behavior.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="using-the-subconscious">Using the Subconscious</h2>
            
            <p>Subconscious is continuously learning. By focusing on the interaction between conscious and subconscious we can improve our learning (Now welcome to Daniel Kahneman's ideas). As we deepen our rapport between conscious and subconscious, we can teach it more complex tasks like detecting certain structural conflicts which in the end improves personal mastery further.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Focusing on the desired result</strong> for example is a skill. Once we learn this skill and once we pick an intrinsic personal vision, our subconscious keep our focus on our vision continuously. We focus and perform better when we truly care about the desired outcome.</p>
            
            <h2 id="practicing-personal-mastery">Practicing Personal Mastery</h2>
            
            <p>Practicing Personal Mastery creates more than trivial results in individuals.</p>
            
            <p>A Sufi story talks about a blind man and a crippled man getting out of a forest by blind man carrying the crippled man and crippled man telling where to go. Crippled man represents the intuition and the blind man represents reason. We will find our way out when two are integrated.</p>
            
            <p>Practicing personal mastery doesn't aim to integrate the reason and intuition but they achieve it naturally. The integration is not one or the other at a time. Systems thinking helps with the integration by providing the language to folks to explain intuitions with reason.</p>
            
            <h3 id="connectedness">Connectedness</h3>
            
            <p>When we understand the explanations of intuitions, we see that we do not exist in a different place than the external world.</p>
            
            <p>The story of the baby who happens to hold on to his ear and experiences discomfort without being aware of the fact that he himself is causing the discomfort. He pulls harder to get rid of the discomfort only to make things worse. When he discovers that he doesn't do it again. But as he grows up he starts taking a lot of the things in the world as given and ends up as all of us losing the connection between our actions and the external world.</p>
            
            <h3 id="compassion">Compassion</h3>
            
            <p>As we discover our connectedness and more and more structural processes; compassion is automatic. We begin to see all of use are trapped in structures, structures that are both embedded in our thinking and in our interpersonal social lives. Once we see that we are part of systems that dictate our behavior, compassion comes up by its own rather than feelings of anger and blame.</p>
            
            <h3 id="commitment-to-the-whole">Commitment to the Whole</h3>
            
            <p>And with compassion, we are automatically drawn to the whole. We don't see self motivated goals worthy of being our visions anymore. Our personal visions automatically become more intrinsic.</p>
            
            <h2 id="fostering-personal-mastery">Fostering Personal Mastery</h2>
            
            <p>If you want people not to develop their personal mastery, just force them. For sure it will backfire.</p>
            
            <p>Fostering it requires setting up a right environment for people to be able to develop their skills and being a role model.</p>
