          </h3>
          <article>
            <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahzarin_Banaji">Mahzarin Banaji</a>'s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blindspot-Hidden-Biases-Good-People/dp/0553804642">Blindspot</a> is an easily approachable book that discusses the biases we all carry subconsciously. For a more in depth study of the topic Kahneman's <strong>Thinking Fast and Slow</strong> is a more appropriate book.</p>
            
            <p>Banaji calls the biases <strong>MindBugs</strong>.  They can be classified into two: Personal vs Social. She goes into a lot of details around memory on the Personal side and stereotypes and race on the social side. Here is a very high level summary:</p>
            
            <p>Memory is a tricky tool. Most of the times when we retrieve something from our memory, we find ourselves pretty confident about it. However in reality this is far from truth. Memory doesn't work as a computer hard disk. It doesn't store an experience and play it back exactly as it is. It stores the experience in relationship to all other previous experiences and mental models we have in our minds and it retrieves similarly. Here is an example:</p>
            
            <p>People watching a video of a car crash remember the event differently when asked about "Do you recall how the blue car smashed into the red car?" vs "Do you recall the how blue car accidentally hit the red car?". They also form different initial opinions / prejudices against the driver of the blue car based on the question they are asked. This is called Retroactive Interference. An event interferes with the memory of a different event.</p>
            
            <p>We can recall things with higher repetition more easily therefore we are more confident about the details of these memories. Vividness also increases the availability of the events from memory. It is more easier to remember "how I splashed wine over the pure white carpet violently when leaving the room" than "how I throw the wine glass to the floor when leaving the room".</p>
            
            <p>When it comes to social biases, we all prefer and associate things based on personal and collective historical experiences. It is proven with Implicit Association Tests (IATs) that pretty much all of us has racial and gender associations (even feminists). However note that discriminatory behavior is not necessarily directly correlated with having an implicit association.</p>
            
            <p><code>
            A man and his son are driving to a championship football game. On the road, they crash into a car. The father is killed instantly, and the son, critically injured, is rushed to the hospital. As the medics rush the son to the operating room, the doctor walks in and say’s, “I can’t operate, that’s my son”.
            </code></p>
            
            <p>How could this be true?</p>
            
            <p>Stereotypes are both true and false. They are a byproduct of our minds which is continuously classifying information in the world into certain buckets. They change over time. They are mostly negative (I'm fully bought into this idea). They can be harmful to our society because they impact convictions of judges, treatment of doctors. They can be also harmful to ourselves because they can turn into self fulfilling prophecies.</p>
            
            <p>Interestingly according to a study Turkish stereotype in 1930s was in the order of priority:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Cruel, very religious, treacherous, sensual, ignorant.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Same study found out the Turkish stereotype in 2001 to be:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Very religious, extremely nationalistic, tradition loving, quick tempered, aggressive.</li>
            </ul>
