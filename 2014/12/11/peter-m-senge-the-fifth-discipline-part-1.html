            <p>The Five Disciplines represent approaches for developing three core learning capabilities.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Fostering Aspiration
                <ul>
                  <li>Personal Mastery</li>
                  <li>Shared Vision</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Reflective Conversation
                <ul>
                  <li>Mental Models</li>
                  <li>Dialogue</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Understanding Complexity
                <ul>
                  <li>Systems Thinking</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Deming points out that management systems and our education systems are very much alike. The 8 elements that Deming points out under the context of Total Quality Management can be applied to education systems as well:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Management by Measurement: Focusing on short-term metrics, Devaluing intangibles.</li>
              <li>Compliance-based cultures: Management by fear. (Again more Ken Robinson’s talk.)</li>
              <li>Managing outcomes: Management sets targets. People are accountable reaching them without the permission to change the system.</li>
              <li>Right Answers vs Wrong Answers: Technical Problem Solving is emphasized.</li>
              <li>Uniformity: Superficial agreement is more important than conflict.</li>
              <li>Predictability / Controllability: Holy Trinity of Management: Plan - Organize - Control.</li>
              <li>Excessive competitiveness and distrust: Competition is essential to outcome and innovation.</li>
              <li>Loss of the whole: Fragmentation.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="how-our-actions-create-our-reality-and-how-can-we-change-it">How our actions create our reality… and how can we change it?</h2>
            
            <h3 id="five-disciplines">Five Disciplines</h3>
            
            <p>For an innovation to occur you need more than 1 piece of technology. Consumerization of the aircraft required 5 technologies: variable-pitch propeller, landing gear, light-wieghted body, radial air-cooled engine and wing flaps. Without wing flaps Boeing couldn’t successfully innovate 1 year before McDouglas. Similarly a learning organization needs to master 5 separate but re-inforcing skills:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Personal Mastery: Discipline of continuously clarifying and deepening our vision.</li>
              <li>Mental Models: Deeply ingrained assumptions, generalizations, even pictures &amp; images that influence how we understand the world. Working with mental models require us to turn the mirror to inside, i.e. trying to understand how we understand things.</li>
              <li>Building a Shared Vision: Unearthing shared “pictures of the future” that foster genuine commitment and enrollment rather than compliance.</li>
              <li>Team Learning: Capacity to make “dialogue”, to suspend assumptions and enter into a thinking mode. When possible IQ of the team becomes higher than the individuals forming the team however this happens seldomly.</li>
              <li>Systems Thinking: As a Toyota manager pointed out, West does all the things we do but still can not reach similar results. Because in addition to having individual components, bringing them together as a whole is another requirement. This is why System Thinking, the binding discipline is the Fifth Discipline.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>What do we mean by learning is really important. It is not reading a book, passing your class, getting AA from the exam, getting a plus from your teacher, promoting to Senior Software Engineer. In addition to these, it is internalizing a certain piece of information, working on adopting this information and changing your behavior along this information. You don’t learn bicycle riding after reading a book. Learning is getting to the heart of it and also of ourselves.</p>
            
            <h3 id="learning-disabilities">Learning Disabilities</h3>
            
            <ol>
              <li>I am my position: In our jobs, most of us see ourselves in a system on which we have no influence. We describe the task we do day to day, not the purpose of the greater enterprise.</li>
              <li>The enemy is out there: When we think ourselves as our jobs, as a result we think that enemy is out there when something goes wrong. We don’t generally see the secondary (or further) consequences of our actions beyond our immediate circle.</li>
              <li>The illusion of taking charge: Taking aggressive action against an external entity during crisis is not really being proactive. Most of the times pro-activeness is reactiveness is disguise. True pro-activeness comes from seeing how we contribute to our own problems.</li>
              <li>The fixation on events: When two children get into a fight it goes like “But, he hit my ball” / “But he broke my toy” / “But he called me …” Focusing on the events distract us from seeing the longer-term patterns of change that lie behind the events.</li>
              <li>The parable of the boiled frog: We can not escape the fate of boiled frog until we slow down and see the gradual processes that often pose great threats.</li>
              <li>The delusion of learning from experience: True learning comes from experience. But if we can not observe the consequences of our actions (because they are in distant feature or they are in a separate part of the organization), we can’t learn from them. Each of us has a “learning horizon”. Cycles are especially hard to see. For e.g. due to lack of chip designers, most of the students are going into chip design which over-saturates chip designers when they are graduating which makes very few people to go into it which results in a shortage after 4 years etc…</li>
              <li>The myth of the management team: The management team who should be able to fight these disabilities generally end up fighting for turf, trying to save their image… They operate well under routine conditions but their “team-ness” goes away when under pressure.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3 id="prisoners-of-the-system-or-prisoners-of-our-own-thinking">Prisoners of the system or prisoners of our own thinking?</h3>
            
            <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_distribution_game">Beer Distribution Game</a>: Composed of Retailer / Wholesaler / Brewery. An advertisement bumps the customer demand by 100%. This creates a cycles of inventory shortages followed by over-stocking.</p>
            
            <p>Independent of the people who are playing the game, the end result is generally the same. Players end up blaming each other and assume their problems are due to fluctuating customer demand even tough in reality it is stable. The lesson is that structure of the system influences the behaviors of the players. There are good strategies to play but we don’t stop &amp; think to find them. Structure in human systems is subtle and leverage most of the time comes from new ways of thinking.</p>
            
            <p>Tolstoy argues that Napoleon wasn’t the cause of the Wars / Revolution. History, and many number of individuals created Napoleon then took him down. (Salut to Geopolitics concept). “Structure” used here doesn’t mean the organization chart or logical structure. It points to the “key interrelationships that influence behavior over time”. E.g. “delay in the delivery from wholesaler to retailer” increases “the order of retailers from the wholesaler”.</p>
            
            <p>In order to be successful, one must re-define their scope of influence. Your influence is broader than the limits of your position. Retailer can influence suppliers behavior by placing orders or not. “Either the large system works, or your position will not work."</p>
            
            <p>Systems perspective shows us that there are multiple levels of explanation in any complex situation:</p>
            
            <p>Systemic Structure - generative -&gt; Patterns of Behavior - responsive -&gt; Events - reactive</p>
            
            <p>Since event explanations are the most common in contemporary culture, reactive management prevails. Behavior pattern explanations focus on seeing long term trends and assessing their implications. E.g. distributions systems are prone to instability which becomes more severe the further you move away from the retailer. This level helps us understand and respond to shifting trends. Structural explanation is the least command and most powerful. They explain the causes of the patterns of behavior. Franklin Roosevelt explained how the banking system worked in a public speech about why “Bank Holiday” is happening and was successful in shifting the negative public view on the topic.</p>
            
            <p>When we understand the structure of the system that causes its behavior, we can clearly see our power to change that behavior. Most of the time we discover something similar to what Walt Kelly discovered in Pogo:</p>
            
            <p>“We have met the enemy and he is us."</p>
